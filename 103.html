  <h3>Prologue.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.37">Before he got sick, he pictured the world this way. There are the people who are healthy, like him, and people who are sick, other people. And unconsciously, as we all do, he drew a line between the two groups, the two countries. Then when Paul Cowan was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987, he was struck with the fact that these are not, of course, two different populations, the sick and the healthy. Instead he wrote, "The world is composed of the sick and the not yet sick."</p><p begin="00:00:29.43">He published an account of his illness in <i>The</i> <i>Village</i> <i>Voice.</i> "I want to describe some of what I've seen during the voyage I've made, the journey from being a person who took his health for granted to one who's trying to survive a life-threatening illness. I want to chart some of this wilderness for others who will be here one day." Well, that's the mission of today's radio program, because all of us, you and me both, if we're lucky, if we don't die when we're young, this is where we're heading, heart disease, cancer. Men have a one in two lifetime chance of getting cancer. For women, it's one in three. If you're a man hearing the sound of my voice right now, I want you to look at yourself for a moment. It's you or me, man. Odds are one of us will get it. Or we'll both get it. Two other guys will go off scot-free.</p><p begin="00:01:25.81">So let us chart this terrain where, if we all live long enough, we will be entering. Cowan writes, "During the past five months, I've learned that there's a land of the sick. When you receive a passport, an unwelcome diagnosis, you learn that the land has its own language-- medical terminology-- its own geography-- hospitals, outpatient clinics, blood testing labs, doctors' offices-- its own citizens-- other sick people-- its own pantheon of heroes and authority figures-- doctors, medical researchers, hospital administrators-- its own calendar dictated by the changes in one's body or by the results of medical tests."</p><p begin="00:02:02.59">When you're well, it's hard to remember what it's like to be sick. And after just a brief time in the hospital, Cowan found it hard to remember what it was like for him just weeks before to be active and self-sufficient. His picture of himself changed. He struggled to retain ties to the land of the healthy, to see himself as an exile who would return one day. But he did not return.</p><p begin="00:02:30.11">Well, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.63">In 1995, Rebecca Perl had a new baby boy that she and her partner, Tom, named Griffin. She was a health science reporter with National Public Radio in Washington, D.C., where she'd just won a Peabody Award for an investigative series about the tobacco industry. She did a lot of stories about doctors and medicine. Then she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and entered the medical world as a patient. She had six months of radiation and chemotherapy. It didn't work. So in the winter of 1996, as a last attempt to save her life, she and Tom traveled from their home in Maryland to Omaha, Nebraska, to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for a bone marrow transplant and another round of chemotherapy, a round of chemotherapy as much as 10 times stronger than the original. Dan Collison, a friend of theirs and a radio producer, went with them, and he documented what happened. He also interviewed Rebecca a year later. This is her story.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:03:51.89">Daddy and Dan and I are going away, Griffy, for a little. We're going on a trip. You're going to stay with Grandpa and Grandma, with Pop-Pop and Grandma, OK?</p><p begin="00:04:04.29">Sometimes I worry that Griffin's going to fall in love with some woman who just lays in bed all the time because that's what he sees his mother doing in the first two years of his life. I mean, he's going to fall in love with some woman who lies in bed and eats bonbons or something, or reads or something, because that seems to be what I'm turning into is this person who lies in bed all the time. Or else I lie on the couch and read him books or something.</p><p begin="00:04:29.41">"Once there were three baby owls, Sarah, Percy, and Bill. They lived in a hole in the trunk of a tree with their mother owl. The hole had twigs and leaves and owl feathers in it. It was their house. One night they woke up and their mother owl was gone. 'Where's Mommy?' said Sarah. 'Oh, my goodness,' said Percy. 'I want my mommy,' said Bill."</p><p begin="00:04:53.25">He really likes the owl book, and it makes him feel better that in the owl book, the mommy owl goes away but then she comes back. So I think he understands that. And lots of mothers go away on trips and go off for work for weeks at a time. And I've had to do that. Now the really bad one is I'm going to have to go away for a month or more. And he'll hopefully come visit. But still, it's going to be a really long time. I mean, it happens. And I guess the most important thing is that I get well so that he can have a mother.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:05:28.17">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:05:28.82">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:05:30.74">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:05:32.18">Bye bye, Griffy.

First, Tom, my partner of 10 years and the father of our son, Griffin, had a kidney transplant in 1988, so he's supposed to be the one with the health problems in our family. If I ever envisioned myself in a hospital, it was standing at his bedside. Second, about six years ago, my older brother Josh was diagnosed with leukemia. And I don't think anyone expected two serious cancer patients in our family. Third, I'm a health reporter, and though my focus has always been on patients and how they're affected by our health care system, I never thought I would end up as one of these people.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:30.91">And they're off on a big road trip. You got your warm coat?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:07:34.69">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:35.99">OK, and we got lots of turkey sandwiches.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:07:38.98">Maybe it was a little crazy to drive all the way to Omaha in the dead of winter, but I hate to fly, and Tom likes road trips. I think we were determined to make the trip fun. Driving would give us a sense of where we were going. Plus, we got to stop at The Waffle House.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:55.71">We're in the bathroom of The Waffle House. Did you lock the door?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:07:59.26">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:07:59.57">And I'm going to give myself an injection of Neupogen. It's just like being a heroine addict.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:05.17">For me, it was the worst part, having to give myself shots. For one thing, it hurt. And it was a symbol of what I was going through.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:08:14.50">And then the funnest part is you jab it into your leg like so. And then you just push it in. And sometimes it hurts, and sometimes it doesn't. It sort of depends on where you get it in the leg. Voila. And that's it. I used to do it at home when I had to do it for like 10 days. I'd do it at like 7:25, right before <i>Seinfeld</i>. So if it took me more than five minutes to do it, I'd miss <i>Seinfeld</i>. So I'd hurry myself along. Now I'm doing it right before I get to eat at Waffle House. So I give myself a treat afterwards.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:08:50.38">BLT on wheat.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:08:52.24">Mmm!

They messed up at the hospital. The line that was supposed to administer the chemo wasn't in the right place, so the drugs went into my belly instead of my bloodstream. Because of this, my bladder hurts and I'm tired. And I'm about to embark on a nasty, exhausting journey. I feel as if I need more strength, but here we go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 3</h4><p begin="00:10:03.70">We're going to do your EKG right in this room.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:10:05.97">OK.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:10:06.90">The first week in Omaha felt like boot camp. I shuffled from one test to another.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:10:15.69">Three more seconds. Keep going. A couple more breaths. Stop. Good. Good test.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:10:21.75">Endless poking and prodding.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 4</h4><p begin="00:10:23.59">OK, Rebecca, you're going to feel a poke and a burn. This is the numbing medication.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 5</h4><p begin="00:10:28.99">There's a tiny little poke. I'm sorry. Your skin's a tiny bit tough.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 6</h4><p begin="00:10:35.25">One more to go after this, honey. It's not bothering you, is it? OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:10:40.45">I'm just tired of being poked and prodded and pricked and achy and tired. This is supposed to be the easy time. I can't imagine it being any worse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Byar</h4><p begin="00:10:57.23">Tomorrow-- don't eat or drink after midnight tonight. Tomorrow at 8 o'clock, you'll go down to the first floor of the hospital to special x-rays.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:11:07.30">Kathy Byar was my nurse coordinator. She seemed more interested in keeping me on schedule than in what I was going through. We called her my drill sergeant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Byar</h4><p begin="00:11:16.98">You know, I would imagine it does feel like that because you lose that control. All of a sudden, you're coming to a strange institution. They're telling you when, where, and what to do. And as a person that's young, independent, used to having her own kind of control, it's very frustrating.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:11:38.06">I'm a medical reporter, so I was used to asking a lot of questions. And maybe they just weren't used to pushy New Yorkers in Omaha.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:11:46.02">You've got to get me on a later schedule. I'm too exhausted.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:11:50.27">And I didn't like Kathy's cheerleading.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Byar</h4><p begin="00:11:52.68">Positive attitude. Positive attitude. You're not going to feel sick.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:11:56.71">I just wasn't in the mood, you know? I'd been through a lot already. And I was tired. I remember she would say, positive attitude, positive attitude. And I just felt like hell, you know? I had a positive attitude the first time around, and it didn't work. I mean, now I was going through something even worse. And it was hard for me to keep positive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Byar</h4><p begin="00:12:18.70">You're not going to feel sick. Not going to get sick. Not going to get sick.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:12:22.94">One coping mechanism I did have was to act like a health reporter. I was obsessed with the numbers. It was really important for me to know the odds that the transplant would work. Those odds were about 50-50. So sometimes, sitting in a room with other patients, I couldn't help but think that only about half of us were going to make it. And this made it kind of hard to get close to people. But Graham and his family was an exception.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:12:48.69">Hi, ?] I'm Graham [? Brazier. ?] I'm here for a bone marrow transplant because of multiple myeloma, which is a disease that was diagnosed in May of '96.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:13:01.06">Graham was a young father facing worse odds than me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Graham Brazier</h4><p begin="00:13:04.49">The latest statistics are that three years out from transplant, 35% are disease-free, as they call it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:13:12.40">His wife, Lorraine, was playing the support role and caring for their 9-month-old redheaded son, Thomas. Even though I admired Lorraine for being able to be a mom there at the hospital and even though Thomas made me miss Griffin, I was glad Griff wasn't there. He was older than Thomas. He was nearly a year and a half. I was afraid that if he were there with me, he would understand too much. And I didn't want him to have to understand anything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:13:40.39">Hi, Griffy! Hi, Griffy!</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:13:44.76">So I settled for the occasional phone call.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:13:47.85">Hey, Griffy, want me to sing "Macaroni"? I have a little pony. His name is Macaroni. He trots and trots and then he stops. My funny little pony, Macaroni. Do you like that song, Griffy?</p><p begin="00:14:05.90">I don't know. In a lot of ways, I guess I have kind of removed myself from him, because I know I have to go through this and do this. And it's sort of the last thing I have to do before I can really be with him for real or have the energy for him for real. So a lot of times I don't have the energy for him, and that makes it easier to kind of separate from him.</p><p begin="00:14:27.34">Griffy, I miss you. I'll see you soon. I love you. I love you, Griffy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Computerized Voice</h4><p begin="00:14:50.85">Breathe in. Hold your breath.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:14:54.85">December 10. We get some bad news. The CAT scan shows the most recent round of chemotherapy back in Washington hasn't shrunk the tumor nearly at all. Julie Vose is my doctor in Omaha.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:15:07.41">Rebecca still has a mass found on her CT scan. So we're going to administer another cycle of salvage chemotherapy that's a slightly different type, to try and reduce that mass further down before she actually undergoes the transplant. And we've found in the past that this is the best way to try and have the best long-term outcome for patients.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:15:27.03">The good news is I'm actually feeling much better. So that night, we celebrate.</p><p begin="00:15:39.53">We're even out at a restaurant. Not just any restaurant, but a find of a restaurant, this Catfish Lodge here in Omaha, with the white albino catfish in the tank in the middle. I'm actually feeling good tonight. It's like a miracle. I haven't felt like this. I'm not, like, crying or in pain or something.</p><p begin="00:16:16.86">Two days later, I begin the Omaha chemo.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:16:20.83">They give you four drugs, and one of them is blue. I kind of like the blue one, because it's just so startling. It looks like blue food coloring kind of color or like blueberry frozen popsicle melted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 3</h4><p begin="00:16:40.24">And you said that you dressed accordingly today?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:16:43.72">Yes, I wore my blue pants to go with the blue. My electric blue pants to go with the electric blue poison.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:16:50.75">The American Cancer Society offers classes in how you can look better and feel better. And though it sounded hokey at the time, now I understand why they do this. Getting sick really played havoc with my body image. I felt as if my body had betrayed me like a separate person I couldn't trust. My sexual desire went out the window. I figured I wouldn't mind losing my hair because at least it wouldn't hurt. But looking at myself in the mirror was like looking at a Holocaust victim, all skin and bones. Actually, I've always been tiny and scrawny, but I never minded before. So I avoided mirrors and wore a hat even when the weather got warm. I did break down and let Tom style the little bit of fuzz that was still left on my head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:17:34.40">This is the weapon.

So finally it's time to get on with the bone marrow transplant.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:18:13.66">I mean, it's discouraging that the tumor hasn't shrunk any. I was hoping it would shrink with these last bunch of chemos. I'm just anxious to get done. And I'm hoping it's really going to work. And I'm kind of wondering about what's the chances it's really going to work. They can't be as good as they would be if the tumor had shrunk a lot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 8</h4><p begin="00:18:34.69">Is it OK if I go ahead and get your consent form signed today, so we're all ready to go when you're ready to go?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:18:38.71">Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 8</h4><p begin="00:18:39.21">OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:18:39.91">The consent form is a reminder of what I'm in for. It lists all sorts of nasty things that could and sometimes do happen when you have a bone marrow transplant-- kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 8</h4><p begin="00:18:53.02">It sounds really scary, and that's because we have to put every little last thing in here that could possibly happen. That doesn't mean it's going to happen. But we have to let you know that's a rare possibility.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:19:02.93">It didn't help to see the transplant patients who were a week or two ahead of me. They had just been where I was going, and they looked so weak shuffling into the clinic. But our friend Graham had his transplant two days ago, and he seems to be doing pretty well.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:19:17.75">Everybody ?] seems to be different. And some people, I understand, end up on ventilators. The worst thing I experienced up there, apart from the nausea, was lockjaw. And that was just a strange sensation, the way your jaw freezes up and your tongue starts sucking down your throat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:19:39.00">People on the transplant unit seem to fall into two groups. There are the ones who get their chemo and get out, and there are the ones who get infections and end up on respirators. This winter, a lot of patients have gotten influenza. They're on respirators, and they're taking a long time to recover. There is a shortage of beds, so I wait, spending most of my time inside the clean, cozy apartment we have rented. I sit on the rose-covered couch and watch the sparrows out the window. It's very cold.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Bradley</h4><p begin="00:20:07.70">WOW FM, Omaha-Council Bluffs. Good morning, I'm Mike Bradley. The Omaha metro area, as well as other areas in east central Nebraska, northern Nebraska, and all of southwest Iowa under a winter storm warning for blowing snow and dangerous wind chills, down to 65 to 70 below zero.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:20:28.02">As we wait, I'm thinking about what's going to happen. Even though they call it a bone marrow transplant, which conjures up images of long, dagger-like needles being jabbed into the spine, actually, they collect the bone marrow, or stem cells, from my blood with a contraption much like a dialysis machine. The machine borrows your blood, culls it for stem cells, and then gives it back. It's the stem cells that produce red cells, white cells, and platelets, all of which will be wiped out by the high doses of chemo. Dr. Ruth Kessinger pioneered the treatment in Omaha.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ruth Kessinger</h4><p begin="00:21:02.69">The machine empties the cells into a very important, special bag. We take the bag of cells to the laboratory. And in the laboratory, we freeze them in a liquid nitrogen freezer and save them there. Then the patient can go get his or her high-dose therapy. The high-dose therapy, of course, is intended to kill tumor cells. But the doses are so high that it also hurts the bone marrow. And that's the reason you need to give the stem cells back to the patient so they can grow a new bone marrow.</p><p begin="00:21:41.21">So as soon as the high-dose therapy is finished, and hopefully the cancer is finished too-- it's been killed-- then we get the cells out of the freezer. We thaw them, and we simply inject them back into the bloodstream of the patient. And like a miracle, these stem cells know where to go. They home right to the empty bone marrow space and begin to grow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 9</h4><p begin="00:22:05.67">Hi, can I help you?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:22:06.71">Hi, I'm supposed to be admitted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 9</h4><p begin="00:22:08.69">Oh, OK.

From the veteran patients, I hear that the University of Nebraska Medical Center doesn't like to give out Zofran, an anti-nausea drug that's very expensive but works like a charm when you're getting chemotherapy. So I start to insist on it to everyone I see. I tell the nurses--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:23:46.20">I'd like to have Zofran because that's worked for me in the past.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:23:50.75">--the resident--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:23:51.98">But I really do want Zofran, because I know that works for me.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:23:56.31">--and the head doctor.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:23:57.63">I just feel like I've said this to so many people so many times.

It's a reminder of what it means to be a patient. You can ask, but sometimes you have very little power.</p><p begin="00:24:26.77">During my high dose chemo, I find out that Graham is back in the hospital on a ventilator.

And it was very awkward because they were there to sort of try to, solicit important things out of me about how I was feeling. And I just didn't want to have any part of it. They kept asking me-- the social worker, when I first went into the hospital, she would say, well, are you involved in any religion? And I'd say, no. And then she would say, well, I don't mean organized religion but just your own spirituality. And I'd say, no. And she'd say, well, what about some sort of mystical or some other culture? Are you involved in-- No. I was just sort of no, no, no to all her questions. And I think she didn't know exactly what to make of that because I don't think almost anybody had ever said, no, no, no to all her questions.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:26:07.90">What worked for me was to work. One of the reasons I wanted to do this documentary was to have a distraction. It was a way to think of myself as a journalist, a working person, as opposed to somebody who was going through a really terrible, grueling medical ordeal. As a reporter, I had learned to be skeptical about medical breakthroughs and miracles, but as a patient, I had to be a believer. So I put my faith in the science, the numbers, the statistics. And for support, I had Tom, who I call [? Zuli, ?] and he was a huge comfort to me.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:26:42.22">Somewhere along the line without saying anything, I think we sort of decided when I got sick or something, we just sort of called a truce or something, each of us did. We almost never fight now. Both of us pretty much kind of let things just slide. If I'm pissed off about something, I just sort of say, oh well. He does the same, I think.</p><p begin="00:27:06.64">Of course we did have our moments.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:27:08.65">If you get upset at me and want me to leave, just tell me to leave.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:27:11.53">I don't want you to leave, [?

I think it's really hard for him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:27:37.49">She actually said something at that point that was kind of enlightening to me.

And I'm here because last night at about 11 o'clock, I noticed that my heart was beating so fast that when I was laying on the bed, I'd just feel it going thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump thump-thump.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:36:12.39">It was beating really fast.

Let's go.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:36:25.50">So I just kind of got out of bed and started to come in. And I sat down on a chair in the living room for a minute, but I must have fallen over because the next thing I knew I was on the floor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:36:36.77">And then I heard a thud. And I came running out. And Bec was spread eagle on her back, just flat on her back, staring up. And I went and looked in her face, looked in her eyes. And she wasn't registering. And I said, Bec, Bec, can you hear me? Bec. And she just didn't register me. Her eyes were blank. And I was just scared [BLEEP] that something had really happened, like she had had a heart attack or a stroke or something. And then within a couple seconds, she came back. And she registered me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:37:19.81">And then we walked out to the car. And then we drove pretty quickly to the hospital. And suddenly there were like a million nurses and PAs and internal medicine guys all in here hooking me up to these monitors and seeing what was going on with my heart. And it was beating at like 190. But the thing that stopped it was they gave me this weird drug which they just put into your catheter, and it makes your heart stop for like three seconds. And it was a weird, unpleasant feeling, kind of like an electrical feeling right after it, just like electricity going through your body or something. And I felt really weird. And I still think I feel a little weird from that. But that got my heart rate down to like normal, to like 120.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 6</h4><p begin="00:38:10.78">Hi, I just stopped by to tell you the results of the ECHO. And I think you already know. There was no fluid around the heart. The valves are normal.

And that's completely unsatisfying, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:38:42.45">So they don't know. We don't know. They're not even going to treat it, really. I think I'd feel better if they sort of thought it was something and could treat it. You always think medicine is going to be like that, like you'll find the answer and that will be that. But a lot of times you just don't. We're no closer to knowing what the problem is than when we started out, really, except that they think everything's OK. They think it's behind us, and we're not really going to treat it. But I don't know why my heart was racing like that. It was scary.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:39:18.19">That has stayed with me in a way that nothing else has because it's like losing your innocence or something. I mean, it just seems like this weird thing. My heart isn't supposed to ever stop, and my heart has been stopped. And to me, that represents some sort of loss of innocence, something that just should have never happened. And it sits badly with me. It's almost like everything else is OK, but that really gets me somehow. I wish that hadn't happened.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kathy Byar</h4><p begin="00:40:05.28">So if we can treat this and get it under control, get the virus gone before your white cells return, then that's the best way to do it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:40:13.97">Four days after the transplant, and I'm about to go home to our apartment.

And I think my overall feeling about that was I was just embarrassed to be stuck with that thing on my face. I couldn't even believe it was happening to me. And also, I was mad. I was mad that they were doing this to me. At one point, the doctor said to me, hey, we're not doing this to you to be mean. He had to kind of remind me. And I mean, I knew that, but I was pissed that they were doing this to me. But that anger kept me from being worried or scared, because their fear was that my lungs were going to clog up with this RSV virus and I would get something similar to pneumonia or I wouldn't be able to breathe.</p><p begin="00:42:28.22">[FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:42:40.09">Just down the hall, Graham has been on a respirator for more than a week.

And there was a scared old man with his family who had just arrived for his transplant, looking shaky and small as he sat huddled by the door.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:47:50.66">You don't feel too good, but, you know, at least it goes by pretty-- what's good is the white cells come back pretty fast, so just a matter of about 10 days there where you're really vulnerable.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:48:05.83">Then we say goodbye to Lorraine.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:48:07.14">How's Graham doing?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:48:09.19">Her husband, Graham, is still on a respirator. She tells us that she's losing hope.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lorraine Brazier</h4><p begin="00:48:15.04">It's starting to feel like it's not going to work. Sorry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:48:19.71">No. Don't worry. Forget it. Lorraine.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:48:24.66">I tell her to be optimistic, but I don't know why I'm saying this. In my heart, I know she's right to prepare herself for Graham's death. It's not a good scene. Here I am leaving, getting out of town alive, and Lorraine's world is falling apart. I feel terrible for her, but mostly I want to get the hell out of here. I want to run. Still I hug her, and I tell her not to lose hope.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:48:47.69">That's pretty scary. That's pretty scary. It's early for that still. It's early, though, for that.</p><p begin="00:48:55.09">I have a weird sense of this whole thing with Graham because, I mean, well, now it looks bad for Graham. But for a while there I was thinking he could pull through and make it and the bone marrow transplant wouldn't really work for me. And I could be down, and he could be up. And I mean, nothing's guaranteed here at all.</p><p begin="00:49:13.43">Bye, Lorraine. We'll call you. Yeah. We'll call you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lorraine Brazier</h4><p begin="00:49:18.56">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:49:19.84">Take care. Give Graham a kiss for us. Can you get in there to kiss him? OK. Then do. Bye. Bye, Thomas. Bye, Thomas! Say hi to Kelli.</p><p begin="00:49:49.46">Griffy, you've gotten so big. I'm sorry I had to be away for so long. I was away, but I'm back now. Are you my Griffy? Are you my Griffy?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:50:01.89">I want to believe, and I think I basically do believe that this whole ordeal did not impact Griffy in a bad way. And I think that it didn't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:15.76">Mommy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:16.30">Mommy came back. "'Mommy,' they cried. They flapped and they danced and they bounced up and down on their branches. 'What's all the fuss,' their mother owl said. 'You knew I'd come back.' And the baby owls thought-- because all owls think a lot. 'I knew it,' said Sarah. 'And I knew it,' said Percy. 'I love my mommy,' said Bill."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:37.16">Griffy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:38.12">Griffy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:38.72">Mommy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:39.49">Mommy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:40.07">Griffy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:41.00">Griffy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:41.38">Mommy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:42.33">Mommy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:43.15">Griffy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:43.96">Griffy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:44.30">Mommy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:44.66">Mommy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Griffin</h4><p begin="00:50:46.52">And Mommy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:50:48.37">Mommy.</p><p begin="00:50:52.09">Hi, is this the seventh floor bone marrow transplant unit? I was trying to reach Lorraine Brazier. I'm a friend of hers, and I was on the unit myself. Rebecca Perl. And I was just trying to find out about Graham. He's not in the room anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:51:07.72">February 3. I've been home four days when I call back to Omaha to see how Graham is doing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:51:14.22">This morning. Did they just take him off the respirator? They didn't. He just-- he wasn't breathing. Oh. Oh, gosh.</p><p begin="00:51:29.16">So weird. I mean, this isn't what you expect, you know? I mean, it's rare that people die from the bone marrow transplant, but I guess it happens. But it's rare when you get your own cells. I don't know. I just feel sorry for Lorraine. Because she's got two little kids. One is just one year old, and one is eight years old. That's a lot. And it's just a lot that they won't have a father.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:52:18.42">Springtime. The buds on the maple tree outside our bedroom window have begun to sprout, and so has my hair. I call this tree my hair tree because since I've been having chemo, my hair has fallen out and grown back at the same time the tree has lost its leaves and sprouted new ones.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman 12</h4><p begin="00:52:41.39">Welcome to Omaha's Eppley Airfield. The terminal curb is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:52:50.42">April 15. Three months have gone by, and we're back in Omaha. It's tax day and the day I find out if my transplant worked. This time we're only here for two days, and Griffin is with us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Jennings</h4><p begin="00:53:04.69">That's Dr. Vose.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:05.68">Who is this?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:07.17">That's Griffin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:08.05">How you doing? You taking good care of mom?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:12.16">The news is good. Dr. Vose tells us the tumor has shrunk significantly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:16.77">CAT scan looked really good. They said that the mass was shrinking from where it was. Last time we checked in, it was two by one. That's pretty close to being what we would consider normal size for a lymph node. So it's definitely a lot smaller. It's hard to know for sure if it's completely gone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:30.76">It's definitely not smaller?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:31.54">A lot smaller. A lot smaller.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:34.13">Oh, OK. Well, that's good. Yeah, thank you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julie Vose</h4><p begin="00:53:37.97">Yeah, well, you did all the work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:53:40.75">I think we got about as good news as we could. I mean, it could shrink a little bit more, I suppose. And it's possible that what we're seeing, the reason it's somewhat bigger than a regular lymph node is that there's scar tissue. So hopefully that's what it is and we're OK. And so that's nice. It's good. This is the part where we do the Mary Tyler Moore, like take off hat and throw it up in the air. We need that music. [SINGING] You might just make it after all.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:54:36.01">It's funny when you realize you're going to get your life back, that your job isn't just fighting a disease anymore. Suddenly you have to live. Egad. You can't just sit around and wait to be better. You've got to go back to work or at least do something. Study biology, write a book. That was very strange and difficult for me at first, because for the past year and a half, I'd been doing very little. Reading, resting, looking through catalogs. I was scared to go back to work, to face getting dressed every day, to be busy, on deadline, frantic, to let my orderly life and my time with Griffin get away from me.</p><p begin="00:55:14.69">One year since my transplant. The tumor has shrunk to the size of a normal lymph node, suggesting the disease is gone. I'm back at work, but my energy is still low. I'm tired a lot, and when Griffin gets sick with a cold, I get sick too. And I get it bad. Still, we go on vacation. Tom and I went to Rome this fall. We see friends, make dinner. We even fight. And though my life is pretty good, I don't feel ecstatic, but I feel content. And if I worry, I worry about life returning to the way it was before I got sick.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Rebecca Perl</h4><p begin="00:55:57.27">Sometimes, I think, I wonder if it changed me. You know, like Armitage, who's the head doctor in Omaha, said, you don't go through this without changing. And sometimes I feel like I'm really just the same. I still sweat the little details or get mad if the kitchen is a mess or something, things that shouldn't matter to me anymore having gone through something like this. And yet I still get caught up in them. And so sometimes I think I haven't changed. And that scares me because it makes me think that if I haven't changed, then I do everything the same, then I could get sick again. But if I can learn from this and change, then I won't.</p></div>  </div>
