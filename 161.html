    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.36">A while back, I was in a taxi. The driver was a man named Ali Youssef. He has this pretty music playing on the tape deck, though the tape was a little on the warbly side. So at some point I asked him, what is the music? What is that? And he said, well, that's the music from his country, which, if I remember right, was Somalia. We talked for a while. And then he says to me, that's my wife. I say, really? And he says, yeah.

Linnel Peterson is 40, outgoing. The route she drives, Chicago Avenue, heads from the point where the City of Chicago touches Lake Michigan on the eastern edge of the city out to the western-most edge of the city, a route that is six miles in each direction, so long and slow to drive that in an eight-hour shift she only drives it back and forth four times. She's been a bus driver for six years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linnel Peterson</h4><p begin="00:08:07.95">When I was little, I didn't think you could back a bus up. There was a lot of things. I didn't really think about a bus. OK.</p><p begin="00:08:23.77">What's weird is when you're in your car, and you pull up to a bus stop, and you're getting ready to open the door, and you realize you're in your car. I'm serious. Or like, you know, somebody's running across the street, and you're starting to slow down because, mentally, you've got to pick 'em-- and I was like, OK. Ooh, big truck. He has flammables. I mean, he was flying, right behind us.</p><p begin="00:08:55.55">Hi, Mommy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:08:56.36">Hi baby!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linnel Peterson</h4><p begin="00:08:56.83">How you doin?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:08:57.38">All right.

Bye, Mommy. There are times that I've picked her up, and people get on the bus, and I'm like, that's my mommy, everybody. And they're laughing at me, because I still call her Mommy and I'm 40.</p><p begin="00:09:29.68">Central Park, this is where I grew up at. Two blocks from here. My mom still lives down there. Watch your step. Have a good one. Two, exactly two blocks from here. And this is why I say, this is our bus route, going to school and-- because I went to Orr. And anything that we did, right here in this vicinity. Lydell.</p><p begin="00:10:03.30">The grammar school I went to is a block down there. That's one of the neatest about being in a neighborhood. There are times when I see people who went to school with me, and they'll get on the bus. And I was like, I know you. Didn't you graduate from Orr? Or something like that. Like I'm saying, that's like a 23-year-ago thing. Central is next. Have a good one, baby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:10:29.01">You, too. You too, darling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Linnel Peterson</h4><p begin="00:10:32.82">Thank you, baby. Watch your step. It used to be real nice where we grew up at. And it's like really drug-infested now. When we first moved over there, it was like a lot of Polish people that lived in the area. And that was about 30 years ago, when we first moved there, because I was about 10. Now it's only blacks. You might find a few.</p><p begin="00:11:11.08">OK, when we was in high school-- Hey, babe, step on out. Every so often, like when I pass Kostner, we used to stand outside and wait for the bus. And it would be so many of us, and we were kind of rowdy. The bus driver would kind of pass us up. It would be so funny. Not all the time, but-- Thank you, baby.</p><p begin="00:11:31.29">So what happens is, when I get in that area, I kind of just start laughing. People are looking at me, like what's wrong with her? But people will usually ask me, you must be a nut to drive Chicago every day, because it's like a high-traffic area. But then, I think it's the fact that this is where I grew up at and I feel comfortable in it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:53.63">Linnel Peterson.

Because when I used to, I used to come on Chicago and I would be like, oh, there's a bus. Oh, he's out of place. So you just remember so much from the stuff that happens when you drive out here.

  <h3>Bubble Two. Emerald Green Peugeot.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:39.35">Across the ocean in England, cars are driving along the wrong side of the road, one of them an emerald green four-door car that we would call a Peugeot, but that they would call a Puh-joh. It's driven by Nick Hornby.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nick Hornby</h4><p begin="00:12:53.21">So it's a lovely, sunny, crisp London Sunday morning, and I'm in the car with my son, Danny. Danny's six and autistic. And he loves the car. It really is a bubble to him, and nobody can burst it. When he's strapped into the backseat, he's safe. No other kids can get in his face, like they do out in the world where people fly at him like asteroids towards a spacecraft. And nobody will make him eat food he doesn't want to eat, and the side window is a videotape that never needs changing.</p><p begin="00:13:24.11">He like to know where he's going, though, so he's memorized all the significant routes. This is a kid who only occasionally remembers that the sequence beginning ready and steady is completed by the word "go," but somehow-- and these somehows constitute the enduring mystery of autism-- he's managed to construct a mental street map of the entire London metropolitan area.</p><p begin="00:13:46.30">The route to school is OK, because he likes school. The route to grandma's house is OK, too, not only because he likes grandma, but because she lives 50-odd miles from London, so he gets to stay in the car longer. The route that's not OK is the route to the park. The park's too close to home, which means that the journey's over before it's properly begun. And someone, a bad person, his dad, will make him get out of the car. But it's a lovely, sunny, crisp Sunday morning. We're going to the park.</p><p begin="00:14:24.34">He starts to yell at the top of Delancey street in Camden when we don't turn left into Albany Street. That left turn he sees as his last chance. School was ruled out 10 minutes ago when we didn't turn into Liverpool Road after crossing Holloway Road at Drayton Park. See, Albany Street takes you onto Houston Road, and Houston Road leads eventually to the motorway and grandma's house. But from Delancey Street, we go straight across into Regent's Park Road on our way to Primrose Hill. Doesn't that sound nice, Primrose Hill? Not to Danny it doesn't.</p><p begin="00:14:57.02">The yells get louder when we stop, and reach a sweat-inducing pitch when I open his door. Come on, Dan, I say, in my best fun voice. We're going to the park, the swings, the seesaw. He just turns the yellometer up to 11. I try to lead him out by the hand, but he snatches it away and grabs hold of something, the seat belt, anything that will anchor him inside. So we're fighting, the car and I, for custody of this small boy. The car has one end of Danny, and I have the other. The three of us are like a warring family in a TV soap.</p><p begin="00:15:28.95">I end up dragging my son out by his ankles. A couple look at us as they walk past. They don't say anything, but one day I'm sure someone's going to report me and I'll be arrested. There's a certain irony to this. I learned to drive at the age of 41, entirely because of Danny. I didn't really want to learn, and I have a mild phobia about driving. But public transport, which had served me well all my adult London life, was becoming less and less fun.</p><p begin="00:16:01.86">Danny loves going on trains and buses, of course, but sometimes he didn't want to get off when I wanted to get off, and sometimes he wanted to get off before our stop, and sometimes he decided that he didn't want to wear any trousers on the top deck of the number 19. And though I won all these battles of will, because I'm bigger than him, I wasn't always in the mood to fight them in public.</p><p begin="00:16:22.08">They can be Pyrrhic victories anyway, these fights with autistic kids. Danny's best friend and classmate, Toby, once kicked up such a fuss about having his haircut at the hairdresser's that he had to be held down by his mom and his nanny, at which point a woman ran over and started pummeling them both with her fists. Sometimes I silently dare someone to say or do something, just so I can tell them why I'm having to be so cruel, and hopefully make them feel terrible in the process.</p><p begin="00:16:48.91">So anyway, I took driving lessons for 18 months, and slowly, slowly overcame my fear. And nothing, I felt, after every awful, jabbering, fear-filled 60-minute lesson, could've demonstrated more dramatically how much I love my son. I passed my test first time, and I bought a little four-door Peugeot that I thought he'd love, so I could drive him places like the park. And is he grateful? Is he? Hell. He's holding onto his seat belt for dear life and screaming while I try to pull him backwards onto the pavement.</p><p begin="00:17:23.99">Eventually, he can hold on no longer, and I lift him out and put him down. And after a brief pause during which he recovers his composure and stops yelling, he roars off towards the park gates, because another thing Danny's forgotten until this very second is that he loves the park. He loves the swings and the seesaw, and spinning round and round on the grass until he's dizzy.</p><p begin="00:17:45.41">And it's a lovely, sunny, crisp Sunday morning. And hey, there's an empty swing. And literally within 10 seconds, he's full of smiles and happy anticipation. And there's no trace whatsoever in his face of the ankle-pulling trauma to which he was so recently and cruelly subjected.</p><p begin="00:18:01.24">And I want to find the couple who may or may not have had a disapproving look on their faces when they saw me committee awful acts of violence, and show them just how joyful he is now. But of course they're not around, which is maybe just as well, because in a while I'm going to have to find a way to get him out of this swing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:25.00">Nick Hornby is the author of <i>High Fidelity</i> and <i>About a Boy</i>.</p></div>  </div>

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:27:21.38">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. It's often said that this country was rebuilt in the 20th century to accommodate automobiles. Because of cars, we have the suburbs, the malls, the highway system, much of the physical and commercial structure of this country. And so, if cars are so important, today's program is made up entirely of stories that happen in cars.</p><p begin="00:27:47.03">Outside Washington, DC, a couple times a week, in an '88 Mercury Grand Marquis that he inherited from his mother, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana picks up random passengers from Virginia, drives them into the city during his rush hour commute. Having people in the car means that he can drive in the fast lanes that are set aside for cars that are full. He told me that the conversations also let him know what issues are on people's minds.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Conrad Burns</h4><p begin="00:28:08.83">Politicians, I think, have a big problem. They've never learned the lesson that you can't hear with your mouth open. You know, it's interesting what people talk about, especially-- But they'll always notice, sometimes they notice the Montana plates and they'll say, well, you're from Montana? And I said, yeah, I'm native. They ask what I do. And sometimes I sort of just don't answer or I give them some sort of a nondescript answer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:35.00">Wait, wait. Is the nondescript answer-- Do you just say, I work in the government, something like that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Conrad Burns</h4><p begin="00:28:39.96">I work on the Hill. I tell them I'm one of the ants on the Hill.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:44.65">More or less accurate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Conrad Burns</h4><p begin="00:28:45.88">I would say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:53.20">In a taxicab in New york City, Jeff Perkins tape-records his passengers on a little cassette machine, just to pass the time. He's collected hundreds of hours of tape.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Perkins</h4><p begin="00:29:03.33">Well, I'm trying to kind of focus on a particular subject which I'd like to ask you about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:29:08.55">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Perkins</h4><p begin="00:29:09.01">And the subject is the subject of dreaming. And I'd like to know if you dream vividly, or do you remember your dreams?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:29:17.72">Sometimes I do remember them. Actually, when I was in my early 20s, I was having a recurrent dream of my family being edible. I had dreamt once that my mother was a Fig Newton and that I was dating Mr. Nabisco. And I also recall dreaming that my father's feet were made of roast beef, and that he would sit in his usual chair and slice off pieces of his roast beef feet to feed us with.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:30:07.78">On the other side of the country, where dreams come true, Los Angeles. Cars scoot along the 405 and the 10. When Rob Levine first came out west, he got his first Hollywood job in one of those cars, a mid-1980s BMW 5 series, big heavy car. He as the driver for a movie producer named Edgar Sherick, who was the head of ABC back in the '60s, went on to produce lots of films. <i>Heartbreak Kid</i>, <i>The Stepford Wives,</i> <i>Mrs. Soffel</i>, Woody Allen's first movie, <i>Take the Money and Run.</i> Driver, in this world, can be a job where you train to be a movie producer yourself, which Rob Levine wanted. So he not only took care of the car, he read every script, sat in on meetings, learned everything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Levine</h4><p begin="00:30:45.90">Part of the idea was that I would shadow him. I was expected to know everything he was reading. I was expected to know who he was calling and why. And he would ask me routinely, why am I calling this person? And not just to test me, because he honestly would slip his mind, and I would have to know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:03.97">Wait. He would say, dial the phone for me, why am I calling?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Levine</h4><p begin="00:31:07.93">Yeah, why am I calling this person? And I would have to sort of, because you want to ask him about this project or that project. So if you didn't know, it was, you're in big trouble.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:18.38">Were you a little scared of him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Levine</h4><p begin="00:31:19.39">Oh yeah. Oh yeah, completely. I mean, he was a sort of larger-than-life figure. At that point, he smoked big Cuban cigars, which we'd have to get for him. It was sort of contraband, and we had to get them from Cuba.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:37.68">That was part of your job?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Levine</h4><p begin="00:31:38.86">Oh yeah. Yeah, we had to get them from South Africa, which is like a double no-no.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:42.86">Wait. So because this is during the embargo?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rob Levine</h4><p begin="00:31:45.90">It's during Apartheid, yeah. So not only are you getting contraband cigars, you're getting them through a country that you didn't want to be doing business with. Sometimes we would get them through Canada, too.</p></div>  </div>

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:07.91">Which brings us to this story. Some people do their socializing in the car, just cruising around, running errands with friends, seeing who's out. In a 1991 Toyota Camry, Ernest Castle, a college student, tools around with his friend, Clarence, in the south Chicago suburb where they both grew up, where they both still live with their parents, Hazel Crest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:32:28.46">Sittin' up in here, early Sunday morning. Damn, it must be about 8 o'clock in the morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:32:34.40">Yeah, it's something like that. [INAUDIBLE] 3:30, he's done, mostly.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:32:39.15">This is about as close as it gets on a Sunday. Kind of one of them slow Sundays, on the way to ABC--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:32:46.80">Auto  Parts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:32:47.25">Yeah, Auto Parts. You know what I'm saying? To go get a hubcap.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:32:51.69">Oh, now you're going to Hubcap City. That's right across the street--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:32:56.23">My friend, Clarence, OK, my boy. What clicks between me and Clarence is we're from the same exact place. We're from the same block. We grew up about 600 steps away from each other. We're brothers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:33:09.36">Damn, look at this cat. They gotta be some Mexicans, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:33:12.30">It was. It was. Some kings or something, just with the low-profile tires. Them's about 13s or 12s, so you know he's riding low. The car was, like, about two inches off the ground. And it was just flicking away, painted rims. it was a Neon, but he did the Neon justice, though. He did it justice. I'm going to give him the credit on that one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:33:40.07">Clarence and I, we're definitely trying to do two different things. He's definitely the street-savvy, basically hustler. And me? I'm trying to do my thing in other ways. You know what I'm saying? I'm going to school, right? So that basically keeps us apart for most of the week. But when we come together on the weekend, it all comes together basically in the car. We got the radio. We got the tapes. A couple of beers, a couple of drinks. That's basically the quality of life for us, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:34:17.93">Ooh, that's a nice-ass Chevy. You see that Chevy with the gold rims over there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:34:21.90">Oh, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:34:23.89">Gold flicks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:34:24.72">Damn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:34:25.50">Now, that's a black man driving that probably. You know what I'm saying? Everybody representing in their own way. Without a doubt. That's how different this [BLEEP] is. You see what I'm saying? Our Mexican people like they're [BLEEP] low. You know what I'm saying? Brothers like their [BLEEP] high. Mexicans get, like, smaller rims. Brothers get rims that are too damn big for their car. You know what I'm saying? For real. You know what I'm saying?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:34:53.90">OK, we're rolling along and run into some childhood buddies here. Now, these guys, they're known in the neighborhood. They're known in the neighborhood. You mostly see them all in a group, at least I do. And we roll up on them, and thery see the microphone, and basically everything comes out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:35:13.68">[BLEEP] the police. [BLEEP] the DEA. You know, they [BLEEP] with me for no rhyme or reason, you know? I'm tired of this bull [BLEEP].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:35:22.13">Now, these guys, they've had their run-ins with the law. They've got their little histories, juvenile cases, whatever, what have you. But these guys, let's just say they tend to exaggerate a little bit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:35:38.94">What Marshall was talking about, he was talking about how they was-- Man, he went on into a tangent about getting beat down by the police. But he made it sound like every time he stepped outside the house--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:35:50.01">Exactly. I think people that got too wrapped up into the movies, into the tapes they play, and they feel, because of the people on the tapes and in the movies get harassed by the police, that they are really getting harassed. They're not getting harassed, man. Police just came around the corner. Man, we should go around there and see what their business is, yo.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:36:12.94">Hey, whatever.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:36:13.82">Oh, they're real. Let's be on some investigative reporter type [BLEEP].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:36:17.78">And so me and Clarence, we decide to conduct our own little case study here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:36:23.13">Right now we are busting the U-turn, trying to see if the police is really gonna go and hassle them like they said they was. This whole conversation was about police harassment, profiling, this and that, which is definitely, definitely, definitely real. But we about to see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:36:44.05">The police roll right by 'em.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:36:45.49">Zoom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:36:46.56">Right by 'em.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:36:47.64">Zoom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:36:48.41">No confrontations, no nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:36:50.14">Zoom.

You know what I'm saying? When the microphone turn on, people got a lot of stuff to say, and a lot to talk about. But once it turn off, the mother [BLEEP] go back to their everyday, dull-ass life. He want to portray some sort of lifestyle, like he's being, I don't know, railroaded into the life that he's living.</p><p begin="00:37:29.91">I just feel that he's not doing what he feels he's capable of doing. And that's all of us out here. I'll be damned, we livin' in the suburbs. You know what I'm saying? I mean, me, myself, and the situation I'm in, is because of the life I have lived since I was a kid, coming up. I really wasn't on my P's and Q's. You know what I'm saying? I've been messing up for a nice long amount of time now, to keep it real. That's just how it is. You know what I'm saying?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:38:04.68">For the average mainstream person, middle class and up, they're looking at Clarence, and they're like, oh lord, here comes another wild off-the-hook street thug, ready to do whatever he has to do, wreak havoc, kill, shoot, whatever. But that's not the case at all. The way I see it, it's just like the movie, <i>Slackers.</i> Here's the guy who, he has goals, but he's a procrastinator. He'll sit on his butt until the last minute, and try to do something. He's a slacker. Everybody knows what a slacker is.</p><p begin="00:38:45.27">He just does the little things that he has to to keep a little bit of money in his pocket. And we're all slackers. I mean, I can't even say anything because I'm a slacker myself. But from his perspective, where he's coming from, to be a slacker, you're a hustler in the same breath.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:39:07.90">It's a ditch, man. Oh, shit. See, that's professional driving right there. You've got to know the limitations and the proper mechanical, um-- Ah, the hell with it. It was a nice turn. It was a very nice turn, on my part. I pat myself on the back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:39:31.35">We're passing by this junkyard, right? And I see this "Now Hiring" sign posted up on this 13-foot iron gate. Huge sign, with crimson-embroidered letters, "Now Hiring." I look up at Clarence. And I know he's not going to go for this, but I gotta mention it 'cause that's me. And I'm like, you know, how about the "Now Hiring" sign, figuring this is his opportunity to finally get a job with a tax return that'll keep him from a fair amount of trouble, let's just say.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:40:05.40">They all be hiring.</p><p begin="00:40:08.88">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:40:10.88">You're going to try to call it out for me. Get a job.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:40:14.72">Now, see, I ain't say nothin' about you. See, that's you. That's you over there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:40:19.36">That's all I'm saying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:40:22.09">Look at that big man across the fence, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:40:24.52">I see it, though.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:40:25.60">Now hiring.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:40:26.80">I understand that. I understand that, you know what I'm saying?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:40:33.85">Basically, I think where the fork in the road took place between my life and Clarence's life, it's as simple as he went to public school and I went to a Catholic school outside of my city. Sealed me away up in there, got me in all of these activities. I had no time, basically, in my schedule to get in the streets until the weekend. By the weekend, everybody did their dirt in the week already.</p><p begin="00:41:00.69">Meanwhile, with Clarence, when we were in high school, basically everything opened up. You got your gangs, your different street factions, and it was shiny, like a brand-new golden apple. It was just the street ambrosia. You live forever. I mean, who wouldn't have wanted to be a part of it? I wanted to be a part of it. Neither of us were brains, so I guess he chose an easier route, an easier road.</p><p begin="00:41:32.12">And in the same predicament, to walk a mile in Clarence's shoes, I'd have took it, without a doubt, without a doubt, without a doubt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ernest Castle</h4><p begin="00:41:44.06">All right, we here at Hubcap City. This is a big junkyard, basically.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clarence</h4><p begin="00:41:50.64">Is that a Buick or some [BLEEP].

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:14.67">Some of the most important moments of people's lives happen in cars, though sometimes we are not aware that these are the most important moments in our lives as they're happening. David Sedaris tells this story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>David Sedaris</h4><p begin="00:43:26.22">It wasn't anything I'd planned on, but at the age of 22, after dropping out of my second college and traveling back and forth across the country a few times, I found myself back in Raleigh, North Carolina, living in my parents' basement. After I'd spent six months waking at noon, getting high, and listening to the same Joni Mitchell record over and over again, my father called me into his den and told me to get out. He was sitting very formally in a big comfortable chair behind his desk. And I felt as though he was firing me from the job of being his son.</p><p begin="00:44:01.81">I'd seen this coming, and it honestly didn't bother me all that much. The way I saw it, being kicked out of the house was just what I needed if I was ever going to get back on my feet. Fine, I said. I'll go, but one day you'll be sorry. I had no idea what I meant by that. It just seemed like the sort of thing a person should say when they were told to leave.</p><p begin="00:44:33.65">My sister, Lisa, had an apartment over by the university, and said I could come stay with her as long as I didn't bring my Joni Mitchell record. My mother offered to drive me over. And after a few bong hits, I took her up on it. It was a 15-minute ride across town, and on the way my mother and I listened to the rebroadcast of a radio call-in show, in which people phoned the host to describe the various birds gathered around their backyard feeders.</p><p begin="00:45:00.78">Normally, the show came on in the morning, and it seemed strange to listen to it at night. The birds in question had gone to bed hours ago, and probably had no idea they were still being talked about. I thought about this and wondered if anyone back at the house was talking about me. To the best of my knowledge, no one had ever tried to describe my voice or the shape of my head. And it depressed me that I went unnoticed while people were willing to drop everything for a cardinal.</p><p begin="00:45:38.10">My mother pulled up in front of my sister's apartment. And when I opened the car door, she started to cry, which worried me because she normally didn't do things like that. It wasn't one of those, I'm going to miss you things, but something deeper and sadder than that. I wouldn't know it until months later, but my father had kicked me out of the house not because I was a bum, but because I was gay. Our little talk was supposed to be one of those defining moments that shape a person's adult life, but he'd been so uncomfortable with the most important word that he'd left it out completely, saying only, I think we both know why I'm doing this. I'd assumed it was because of the drugs, and had left it at that. I guess I could've nailed him down. I just hadn't seen the point.</p><p begin="00:46:26.87">My mother assumed that I knew the truth, and it tore her up. Here was another defining moment, and again I missed it completely. She cried until it sounded as if she were choking. I'm sorry, she said. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I figured that within a few weeks, I'd have a job and some crummy little apartment. It didn't seem insurmountable, but my mother's tears made me worry that finding these things might be a little harder than I thought.</p><p begin="00:46:55.32">Did she honestly think I was that much of a loser? Really, I said. I'll be fine. The car light was on, and I wondered what the passing drivers thought as they watched my mother sob. What kind of people did they think we were? Did they think she was one of those crybaby moms who fell apart every time someone chipped a coffee cup? Did they assume I'd said something to hurt her? Did they see us as just another crying mother and her stoned gay son, sitting in a station wagon and listening to a call-in show about birds? Or did they imagine, for just one moment, that we might be special?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:43.63">Dave Sedaris' latest book is called <i>Me Talk Pretty One Day.</i></p><p begin="00:47:50.35">[MUSIC - "I WANT A LAVENDAR CADILLAC" BY MAURICE KING AND HIS WOLVERINES]</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Bubble Six. Yellow Aaa Pickup Truck.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:27.98">There are people out on the road with no other purpose but to help others, as if the streets and highways are like the open sea, dangerous and unpredictable, thousands of motorists stranded at any given moment, needing saviors. And there's a little yellow pickup truck, AAA insignia on the door, tool cases in the back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:48:51.47">370.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:48:53.89">Yes, 370. Good morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:48:56.64">Good morning. Did you say you had a service call holding?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:49:00.16">Yeah, we have a T3 on Prospect. Do you want me to send that over?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:49:03.91">Yeah, 10-4. Prospect, where the [BLEEP] is that?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:09.36">Kelly Keggers wears dark blue pants and a button-down AAA service shirt. The dispatch computer on her dashboard lists AAA members in trouble.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:49:17.76">Well, all I do all day is go out and help people. It's like community service. People call when they're in need, if their car doesn't start, or if they've got a flat tire, or they run out of gas or something. If their car's not working, they call. It's all day.</p><p begin="00:49:38.95">And everytime I show up, people are like all, oh my god, you're here. It's like I'm all doing them a favor or something. It's a good deed job. Early in the morning, though, it's, like, jump-starts, but pretty much people lock their keys in their car. They're getting ready for work, and they're freaking out and-- Oh, here comes my member. What's happening with your car? It won't start?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:50:06.97">Battery's dead. I keep switching the lights on because it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:50:16.26">Her horn did-- like, you know, lights are on the blinker of your car, like if you put the blinker up or down? A lot of people complain about the new Hondas. They turn the blinker on during the day, they're coming home from, blah, blah, blah, whatever, and they leave their lights on all night long. And there's no buzzer or anything to tell them that their frickin' lights are on.</p><p begin="00:50:38.85">So she's all pissed off about that. And she was worried about her battery, but it's a brand-new car. It's a 1999. Oh, wait. Let me get these calls.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:50:47.09">I have three more service calls. Two of them are kind of a ways away, I think. We have this 6 at Third and Cargo. Three at Gillman, and Raymond and Redland.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:50:58.67">OK, I can do all three of those. That's cool. Go ahead and send them my way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:04.79">10-4. Copy that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:51:09.16">I love driving around without a boss in the car with me. I don't like to work with-- I'm not really much of a team player, I guess.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:19.91">On West 7th?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:51:21.18">I don't like to work with people that much. I just like to work by myself and do my own thing. I just get things done faster and better that way. I guess I can just concentrate by myself. I mean, I like helping people, though. I get a kick out of it. It's kind of a good feeling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:42.95">We've got a cancel on our Hazelwood and Rosewood. The member found her keys.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:51:48.54">Cops wave at me when I drive by. Buses stop and let me go by them. It's weird. All city workers are always like, hey, how's it going? Oh, AAA. Hi. You know, waving. And people flag me down a lot when I'm driving. Or if they need a jump-start or whatever, they jump in front of your car with jumper cables. I'm going 40. They fly in front of the truck. You're like, [BRAKING SOUNDS], oh crap. But, no, they treat me really good. They're really nice. I don't get treated like a punk kid, like I usually do.</p><p begin="00:52:32.06">I jump-started some guy's car on 21st, oh no, it was 22nd street, and there's a big, huge hill. And it was a stick shift, and I told him to keep his foot on the brake. And he didn't, of course. And he was an older guy. And I mean, right as soon as his car started, he took his foot off the brake to get out of the car, and it stalled because it was a stick shift and all that. And it went sailing down the street. And it slammed into a tree and totalled his car. It almost ran me over. I jumped out of the way. I pulled a total, like, Dukes of Hazard.</p><p begin="00:53:08.35">And of course we had to call a tow truck for that. But it wasn't my fault. It was his fault. I advised him not to take his foot off the brake, and blah, blah, blah. But he was old and he was a little grumpy. He's like, I know what to do. His wife started screaming at him. It was really upsetting. I sat with him for a while. He was shaken up. He was scared. He was still in the car. I mean, he tried to get out but he couldn't.</p><p begin="00:53:36.83">Yeah, that was my big excitement for one day. But everything else is pretty normal. I mean, you get babies locked in cars and stuff. People are freaking out. I try and get there really fast if there's a baby in the car. So I always do that as a priority.</p><p begin="00:53:59.30">It's cool when you pull into a shopping center, a big parking lot, because you'll always get two or three calls. People will flag you down. And usually they have AAA. And you write them up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:54:11.08">[UNINTELLIGIBLE] again. [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:54:14.47">This parking lot is humongous. Hello. See, you're waiting out front.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:54:22.95">Well, yeah. Got them locked them inside. You know, on the supervisor side.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kelly Keggers</h4><p begin="00:54:27.61">OK, the supervisor side, all right. I'm totally addicted to that getting paid for job performance. Because that way it doesn't make me resentful of the people I work with if they're not pulling their weight. I just figure, they did 10 calls today, and I did, like, 32 calls. I know that I'm getting paid for all the calls I'm doing. I can't deal with getting pissed off at people I work with. But I like all the guys I work with. They're nice guys. There's one or two other girls that work there.</p><p begin="00:55:06.51">But those guys are cool. And plus, you talk to them. We're all talking about our jobs. And it gives me ideas about-- I like to change jobs a lot. I like to be a total jack of all trades and bounce around. I can only stand a job for, like, a year or two. Like, my next job, I'm going to be a truck driver. I'm going to drive the big rigs. That's my dream, just drive across country completely alone, get my dog and truck, and that's it, just listen to music and just drive.</p><p begin="00:55:38.68">This way, right? Third row? One, two-- he's all running. Poor guy.</p></div>  </div>
