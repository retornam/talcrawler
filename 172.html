Scott is dishevelled and tired. He's been working all night as a bartender at a Chinese restaurant, serving lots of free drinks on the sly to Tom. And Tom, in response, seems astonishingly ungrateful. Here is the kind of sass that Tom keeps throwing Scott's way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:00:30.76">You're the one who needed the food and the beers and all that stuff like that to calm down after your traumatic night stealing from your employer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Diner Patron</h4><p begin="00:00:41.15">Really?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:42.51">Just at that moment, a man in a Hawaiian print shirt and khaki pants walks by their table.

You just came walking in--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Diner Patron</h4><p begin="00:01:00.65">You did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:01:00.93">No, I didn't.

But you know what? I'm trained in the art of listening, and I could have sworn you said you wanted to be a  lawyer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:01:19.40">Well, I definitely wouldn't hire you because you heard completely wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Diner Patron</h4><p begin="00:01:23.19">Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom</h4><p begin="00:01:23.54">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:28.56">There are some conversations that you overhear and it's hard not to want to keep listening, or to butt in, even though everybody knows that it is not the right thing to do. A while back, I was sitting in one of the booths in this very diner, The Golden Apple in Chicago on Lincoln Avenue, on a Sunday morning, and I looked around the restaurant. At the table next to me, a family was taking their teenage daughter out to an awkward last breakfast before she shipped off with the military. There were dressed-up people who'd come in from the church across the street and young couples who had stumbled in with the paper and were working on the crossword together.</p><p begin="00:02:00.75">And I thought, if only somebody could interview every person at every table in this restaurant, that would be amazing. You'd get such a wide variety of different kinds of stories from different kinds of people. So we decided to try it. On Friday, July 14, a couple years back, a big group of us took shifts starting at 5:00 AM and going to 5:00 AM the next morning.</p><p begin="00:02:26.12">During quiet hours, it was just one us on duty, recording and interviewing people. During the busiest hours, which means late night, three or four of us worked the tables. Today's program, from WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, 24 Hours at The Golden Apple.

    <div class="subject"><h4>Pete</h4><p begin="00:02:51.64">It's 5:00 in the morning. My name is Pete. I work from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM. And now we're going to have the taxi drivers and the cops come for a cup of coffee, until 6:00, when the morning crowd is going to be in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:08.99">Pete's one of the three owners of this restaurant, along with Nick and Tom. All three are Greek, and one of them is always there, 24 hours a day. The restaurant sits at one of those intersections where three streets come together, not two. So every one of the corners in the intersection is wedge-shaped, which means that the restaurant itself is wedge-shaped, with booths along the windows on two sides of the wedge.</p><p begin="00:03:30.56">There's a counter with stools and a larger room with tables in the back. There are those oversized, laminated menus that go on for pages-- pages-- with pictures of the food. By the door is one of those revolving dessert cases, an octagon made of glass-- three shelves of cream pies and melon slices and cakes that lately have been nothing but trouble. Here's Nick, another one of the owners.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick</h4><p begin="00:03:51.92">It's supposed to be turning. It's not turning because the motor broke. Jimmy's supposed to come out, like, three days ago. He's still coming. Now, if you can figure this one out. The pie case is not turning, and believe it or not, it's not selling as good. That's the truth.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:10.71">Dessert sales are down, he says, by half ever since it broke. People just like desserts more when they're in motion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick</h4><p begin="00:04:18.01">It catches the eye. When it's turning, it catches the eye and it sells.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:25.62">Over the course of 24 hours, the staff at The Golden Apple changes, the regulars who come in change, and the atmosphere changes from quiet in the early morning, to crazy hectic late at night when the bars in the neighborhood let out. Nancy Updike took the first shift of our 24-hour surveillance, mic in hand, from 5:00 AM until 10:00 AM.</p><p begin="00:04:44.87">[HARMONICA PLAYING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:04:49.66">This is Eddie. He comes to The Golden Apple a few times a week in the mornings and plays the harmonica in the middle of the restaurant for a few minutes. He's in a pale blue shirt and hopping lightly from foot to foot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eddie</h4><p begin="00:05:01.48">I might fall down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:05:05.58">Eddie heads to the back of the restaurant to play there. No one is complaining. No one is rolling their eyes. In fact, a few people are smiling and saying hi. Eddie is not an outsider here, he's a regular.</p><p begin="00:05:19.35">Early morning at The Golden Apple is like that, a profoundly democratic place. Early morning welcomes the night shift workers, the unemployed, the retired, the confused, the disappointed, the slightly off, the people who work for themselves, and the people who don't work at all anymore but crave a little morning routine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:05:38.89">Every morning I'm here are between 4:30 and 5:00. I love The Golden Apple. They're wonderful people and they got good food. And, uh, that's it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:05:50.67">This is how Joe Molica ends every sentence--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:05:53.65">And uh, that's it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:05:55.49">Or sometimes--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:05:56.65">That's all I could tell you, honey.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:05:58.82">Joe's not used to talking about himself. His story comes out bit by bit. Our entire conversation takes place in a different era. He's completely unselfconscious about calling me honey. He bangs on his coffee cup with his spoon to get the waitress's attention for a refill. Please don't try this at home, but he gets away with it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:06:18.96">I do construction-- remodeling, rehab. And that's what I do. I retired. I'm 78 years old. And I gave the business to my two sons. And that's it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:06:32.68">How did you start that business?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Molica</h4><p begin="00:06:35.03">Through my dad. My dad done the same thing when I was, I don't know, maybe 10, 11 years old. I started working for him. He was paying me a dime an hour. And that was it. Clean up, sweep up the floors that he's working on. What else do you want to know, honey?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:06:56.02">At 5:30 in the morning, almost everyone is sitting alone, by choice, it seems. Joe's friend Bob is sitting in his own booth behind Joe. No one's talking much, but it's a comfortable silence. When you're up this early, it's hard not to feel some sense of community with everyone else who's awake. But you don't necessarily want to talk to them.</p><p begin="00:07:17.11">As it gets lighter and lighter outside, more people trickle in. A guy with thick, dark, blond hair and a face that looks like it could use another six hours' sleep sits down at the counter. His name is Scott Johnson, and he says he usually comes in around 3:30 AM, but today's different.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Johnson</h4><p begin="00:07:35.51">It's about 20 after 7:00.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:07:37.94">How did you start coming to The Golden Apple?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Johnson</h4><p begin="00:07:40.17">I own a bar right down the street. It's called Witts. And I own another one on Clark and Oakdale called Jake's.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:07:46.69">How did you get into the bar business?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Johnson</h4><p begin="00:07:49.07">Oh, boy. Well, about eight years ago, I turned 30, quit my career, got a divorce, and bought a bar in the same month.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:07:58.62">Oh my God.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Scott Johnson</h4><p begin="00:07:59.62">Took the Etch-a-Sketch and shook it, stood it upside down and shook it it real hard and changed my life forever.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:08:13.90">It's completely light outside now. Commuter traffic is picking up. The Golden Apple isn't crowded, but all the front booths are taken and most of the counter. Nick keeps getting deliveries-- orange juice, potatoes-- and his butcher comes by, John Zervas. John is a big man in that way that's the norm in Chicago-- not fat, just big. John has been eating at The Golden Apple and supplying its meats for 10 years. When he was eight years old, he became famous for being the youngest butcher in Illinois.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Zervas</h4><p begin="00:08:46.10">Back in 1979, I was interviewed by Fahey Flynn. I don't know if you remember, back in 1979, Fahey Flynn was a well-known newsman right here at Channel 7 News before he died in '81. I was the youngest butcher in Illinois in 1979.</p><p begin="00:09:00.31">And-- yeah, I know-- I've met Governor Thompson down Randolph Street. My father was in the retail business, too, on Randolph Street. And that's how I started learning how to cut. So I've been doing this for-- I'm 33 now, and since I was eight years old.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:09:14.71">You were a butcher when you were eight?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Zervas</h4><p begin="00:09:16.03">Well, yeah, I've been involved, cleaning tables. And about 12 years old, I started cutting meat on a band saw.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:09:21.11">Wow. Do you remember the first piece of meat you cut?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Zervas</h4><p begin="00:09:24.13">Pork chops. Piece of pork loin and I sliced it. I remember very well, like it was yesterday. Yeah, real slow on the band saw. Pork chops. Pork loins, like 18 pounds. The first thing I did is cut it down the middle, and I started from the middle.</p><p begin="00:09:35.46">The trick is at the end not to cut your hands when it becomes really small. And you've got to use a special kind of thing that's underneath the band saw, not to put your hand in it. Because a band saw doesn't have any friends. I mean, if it's going to grab your hand, it's going to  cut it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:09:56.53">The front of The Golden Apple is the smoking section. Sitting there is a grayish woman with a fleshy face and wavy hair in one of the small two-person booths. Her name is Alice Deluca.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alice Deluca</h4><p begin="00:10:08.50">I work at a purification center. It's a sauna, running vitamins and minerals. It's a program to rid your body of toxins and radiation.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:23.03">Wow. Have you done the program yourself?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alice Deluca</h4><p begin="00:10:26.33">Yes I have.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:28.62">Now, to the naked eye, it looks like you're smoking and drinking coffee and about to have some sausage. So how does that square with the whole toxins thing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alice Deluca</h4><p begin="00:10:41.95">Well, I'm trying to wake up. [LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:10:46.27">You need some toxins to wake up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alice Deluca</h4><p begin="00:10:50.00">I guess so.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:00.22">The restaurant never gets crowded this morning. Turnover is slow. People linger over their coffee or their conversation. It's a weekday, so there's no impatient lunch crowd waiting for tables to open up. And if you don't have an office you need to get to, why rush?</p><p begin="00:11:17.81">Donna, the waitress, is finishing up the night shift and getting ready to go home. She's been on since 11:00 PM, but you would never know it to look at her. She's six feet tall and looks like Catherine Deneuve. She's one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen in person.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:32.46">How long have you been working here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:11:33.82">Oh, 26 years.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:36.32">Wow. How old were you when you started?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:11:39.82">Well, you think I'm going to tell you that? Are you kidding? My kids don't even know how old I am.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:11:48.08">Donna says she's actually not a night person, but she's worked the night shift the entire time, all 26 years. She came to Chicago from Oklahoma City in her early 20s with three kids.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:11:59.76">I was divorced when I came here. And I had married so young, had my children young, no education. And I had a little baby. That's why I started working nights. But this is a great job for that-- I mean, working nights. That way you're with them during the day. You don't sleep much, but when they're sleeping, you're working. And I'm still working the night shift. I don't know why, but I still am.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:12:26.60">Every Christmas Eve, Donna brings in a big tray of homemade cookies for the homeless guys and the old men and the taxi drivers, anyone who shows up that night. Every once in a while, on her afternoon off, she'll go see a play starring one of the actors who come in every night after their own shifts waiting tables. Her customers give her tapes of the bands they're in, bring in their artwork for her to see, tell her about their successes and failures. These are people she's known for years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:12:54.68">It's It's like home here to me. And when I think about going on a day job, I just can't. It's almost like it'd be another separation because it's like home when you've been here this long.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:13:09.75">Donna runs her shift at The Golden Apple with a lot of compassion and generosity. But like any good waitress, she's also ruthlessly practical. She can be direct when she needs to. Early morning is no time to stand on ceremony.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:13:23.61">Aw, honey, I've got to get finished with the rest of my work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:13:26.21">All right. Are you doing anything to set up or clean up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:13:31.16">I'm going to check and see what I've got to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:13:32.50">Can I just follow you around and you tell me what you're doing? I'll just be your shadow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:13:36.33">But I don't even know if I have anything more to do. I just didn't want to talk anymore.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:13:39.59">Oh, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:13:40.99">I didn't want to be rude.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Nancy Updike</h4><p begin="00:13:42.25">No, no, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:13:44.72">I just thought, I'm tired of talking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:57.54">In the middle of the day, a muted light streams through the windows through a pale haze of cigarette smoke. At certain hours, it feels like everybody is smoking at The Golden Apple, three industrial smoke eaters on nonstop. At lunch, some customers come in, eat quickly, and head back to work after just a half hour, but they're in the minority. Probably 3/4 of the customers are regulars. Many of them stay for hours. Nick the owner says, some come two or three times a day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick</h4><p begin="00:14:22.52">I mean, they go home and sleep, of course. But this is their base. We've got Charlie right now in the restaurant that comes twice, three times a day. Floyd, which is right next to him. Mitch, Mitch with his son on the counter. He's a counter man. Mr. Harlen there with Steven, they come twice a day. Ross comes about three, four times a day. Al, two, three times a day.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:56.38">At the counter, a man who looks a little bit like the actor Harry Dean Stanton, scruffy and lean, is here for the second time in 24 hours. He gives me what he says is his nickname, Robert. He says he usually just comes for coffee. He can't afford much else.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:10.47">So why do you come here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert</h4><p begin="00:15:11.16">Because it's something to do. Coffee. I come here because I'm single, no wife, no girlfriend, no kids, either.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:23.54">Robert is one of three different men who tell me that they come here in the afternoon to drink coffee and talk to the waitresses. All three actually seem a little shy and intimidated by the waitresses. Robert is so bashful, he has a hard time saying much of anything to them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert</h4><p begin="00:15:36.98">I've never said more than hello or goodbye.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:42.20">Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert</h4><p begin="00:15:42.59">That's all I ever said. I don't know what to do with a pretty girl like that. What to say, I don't know what to say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:55.32">At a table in the back, Manuel Hernandez is here for the second time today. He's a retired carpenter. He came to Chicago from Mexico in 1965 as one of the workers who built the Sears Tower downtown, one of the tallest buildings in the world. He quit, he says, when they got to the 105th floor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Manuel Hernandez</h4><p begin="00:16:10.44">It was too windy up there. After two guys fell down, then I quit. Because I don't want to be next.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:21.53">As the afternoon passes, he calls over one of the waitresses, Sherry, and asks her for help reading a document that he got in the mail from an insurance company. He's worried it's some kind of scam. She reads it, tells him no. They've sent him a check. It's real. Sherry says this kind of thing happens all the time. Some of these guys, who else do they have to turn to?</p><p begin="00:16:40.48">Out on the sidewalk, when the weather's good, the restaurant sets up tables. At 1:00, Allison Musgrave and her two kids are eating. Ian is four, Madeline is two. Both are wearing their bicycle helmets at the table and eating the Mickey Mouse pancakes-- three pancakes, arranged in violation of US copyright law. Two ears and a head, maraschino cherries, canned pineapple, and whipped cream as the eyes and mouth. Cover it with maple syrup and you have a sugar concoction so powerful that four-year-old Ian literally cannot sit in his chair.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison Musgrave</h4><p begin="00:17:10.38">Ian? Ian! Around here, please. Thank you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ian</h4><p begin="00:17:16.23">[BABY TALK]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:19.02">I don't live far from here, and I do not think there is a four-year-old in a 10-block radius who does not know the Mickey Mouse pancakes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison Musgrave</h4><p begin="00:17:26.12">Turn around now, Ian. Turn around, please.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:31.43">The restaurant has toys for kids in a corner inside. One couple named Mike and Liz tell us that they come here so often with their four- and seven-year-old and feel so at home here, that they've instructed their kids that if they're ever lost, they're supposed to find a policeman and tell them not to bring them home, bring them to The Golden Apple.</p><p begin="00:17:48.10">As evening falls, it takes a while for the dinner crowd to show up in any kind of force. It's a slow day, everybody says. But it is Friday, and couples start to arrive. Some on dates, some just friends, some of that vague territory in between. And the topics of conversation in the room start to make an orbital shift toward couple sorts of topics. One of our producers, Susan Burton, notices one couple in particular.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:18:12.23">A man and a woman in their 30s sit down in a booth by a window. The man's long hair is tied back with a bandanna.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:18:19.04">I'm Daniel Romero. Sylvia and I just got through playing a few sets of tennis in Grant Park, and stopped at Healing Earth for a little incense and some good karma, and we decided to stop and grab a bite. Sylvia and I have this weird history. She actually dumped me not too long ago. And that's right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:18:44.02">It wasn't a long time ago, Romero.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:18:45.90">A long time ago-- it wasn't that long ago. So she's now happily in a relationship. And I was telling her as I was driving here about how lonely I am.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:18:58.15">Actually, it's been three years since Daniel and Sylvia broke up. They met when they worked together at the same nonprofit organization.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:19:05.65">So you're ready to settle down now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:19:06.94">I am.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:19:08.29">Well, I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. When you first told me that, I actually wasn't sure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:19:13.51">Right. But you will not be coming to the wedding. You already told me that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:19:17.26">I did. I did tell you that. I won't be participating there. You'll have my best wishes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:19:21.52">Why? We're friends. I still love you and care about you. Why can't you be there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:19:27.79">Well, well, why can't-- it would just be weird. I mean, you and I have a pretty significant history together. But I would still be happy for you, and you would have my best wishes, and I'll still buy you a toaster.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:19:43.32">A toaster. OK. See, I think that that's unusual. I think I would be very happy for you. Would I have some feelings there? Yeah, maybe there would be a little twinge thinking, why wasn't it me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:19:58.96">That's actually a <i>Sex</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>City</i> topic a lot. Absolutely.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:20:03.53">In case you've missed it, <i>Sex</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>City</i> is a TV show on HBO. It's about the romantic lives of four Manhattan women, one of whom is a writer. Each episode circles around some central question she poses, like "Can you be friends with your ex?" or "Can you change a man?" Could I have the <i>Sex</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>City</i> music, please?</p><p begin="00:20:22.84">[MUSIC - "SEX AND THE CITY" THEME] Thank you.</p><p begin="00:20:27.61">If Daniel and Sylvia and I were suddenly cast in our own episode of the show, this would be the moment where I would light a cigarette and flip open my Powerbook and ponder what I'd seen. Daniel and Sylvia began by talking about Sylvia's new boyfriend but wound up discussing each other. And I started to wonder, when you talk about your ex's new relationships, are you really just talking about the two of you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:20:51.18">I didn't tell you this. You asked me how my love life was a little bit earlier. I did meet somebody about a week ago. Her name is Amy, and she works at-- where does she work at-- she works at Supercuts. And she was with her boyfriend, actually.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:21:06.95">And she was hitting on you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:21:08.24">And she was hitting on me. She said to me, I want to go out with you. And I said, fine, let's go out. And she says, well, you have to wait a month because I'm still going out with this idiot over here. And she's talking about-- Nothing happened, though.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:21:22.73">You would go out with a woman who would degrade her boyfriend that way, who would treat the guy that she's supposedly dating that way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:21:28.10">Yeah, but I'm not going to marry--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:21:29.22">Right, you'll just [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:21:30.28">I'm not going to marry this girl. I wasn't interested in a lifetime commitment at that moment. I was much more looking for the immediate gratification.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:21:43.13">That's what you're always looking for.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:21:44.63">That's not entirely true. That's not entirely true.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:21:48.13">Each time Daniel brings up someone he's interested in, Sylvia gets exasperated with him for refusing to make a commitment. It happens when he mentions the woman he saw in a lounge chair by a pool in Las Vegas and the girl he's taken on a dozen dates but is pretty sure he wants to break up with. It turns out that this is a conversation they've had before-- at the end of their own relationship.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:22:09.89">I was ready for the next step, and he was ready to back out. Any time I pressed forward, he went backwards a couple steps.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:22:18.70">You're right. You and I were in a place where you were frustrated because I couldn't move forward. I was frustrated because you were pressing so hard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:22:30.22">And then you found the next girl and moved in with her after three weeks. I think it's a hard topic for us both.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:22:44.99">Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, just the thought of-- it's like--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:22:54.34">He trails off, staring out the window.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:22:56.55">I don't know. It's kind of hard to-- it's kind of hard to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:22:59.63">It is kind of hard to talk when two babes go by.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:23:02.58">Outside on the sidewalk, two girls with blond hair and short skirts approach. They catch Daniel's eye. He mumbles. As the girls stride by the window, he turns his head and follows them from one end of the glass to the other. The gesture seems to happen in slow motion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:23:18.19">He does that all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:23:19.37">Yeah, but I'm not--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:23:20.59">I know. I know. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that when we were together and you did that, that really hurts.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:23:27.57">Even though it's just looking?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:23:29.82">It says you're not interested in what's going on right here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:23:32.49">No!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:23:32.58">And that's exactly what you did by doing that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:23:34.34">See that's--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sylvia</h4><p begin="00:23:34.80">You couldn't even formulate the sentence because your eyeballs were glued to that window.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Romero</h4><p begin="00:23:39.74">Look, this has been another topic on <i>Sex</i> <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>City</i>.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Susan Burton</h4><p begin="00:23:46.16">Oh, bring back the music.</p><p begin="00:23:47.27">[MUSIC - "SEX AND THE CITY" THEME]</p><p begin="00:23:51.10">Just for the record, what actually happened in that episode-- the woman got so mad at her boyfriend that she punched him in the face. And then she realized she couldn't change him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:13.96">Over by the restaurant's front windows, which look out on St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, a huge building, sits Kay Frank, known to her friends as Katie Keane, 75 years old, dressed in a nice outfit and matching scarf. She's here because one of her long time neighbors, another Golden Apple customer, is laid out dead in the funeral home right across the street. She'll eat, then pay her respects. She tells me that she's lived her whole life within walking distance of this very spot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:24:39.24">I was born and raised on Lakewood 75 years ago, went to St. Alphonsus School. So this is my neighborhood for a long time. And it gives me a lot of pleasure to walk the neighborhood and say, Margaret Kuntz lived in that house, Lucille Sutchell lived in that house. I can still see all the things in my mind as I did in the '30s and '40s.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:10.85">Back then, for instance, a pharmacy was on this spot. Kay and her friends would come here after 11:00 mass.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:25:17.87">I'm talking about first year, second year high school, when you didn't go to the kiddie mass anymore at 9:00 in the morning. This was like a hang out here after mass. In this whole section here, they had a wonderful soda fountain, right here where this would be. See what I'm saying?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:25:37.70">She points at a section of booths. For years, this neighborhood was all about which parish you belonged to-- St. Alphonsus for the Germans, St. Andrews for the Irish and Italian, St. Josaphat for the Polish. Until finally in the 1960s, that ended. Kay's five sisters and her parents all moved away from the neighborhood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:25:55.03">I'm the only one that stayed in the neighborhood because we couldn't afford to move out of here. We bought our house in the mid '60s, '64. And everybody thought the neighborhood was going to change. So of course, they're moving to the suburbs, or farther north, or farther west.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:12.31">Change-- you mean people thought it wasn't going to be white anymore?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:26:15.44">Yes. They thought it was going to go down. That's why people were scared and moved out. So we couldn't afford to move. So we bought a house there for $27,000. I've had offers of $500,000, $550,000 for my house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:33.86">Meanwhile, one of her sisters who moved away to avoid the blight of this area, who moved to an area too expensive for Kay or her husband to afford, just sold her house for only $200,000. Gentrification, which spread through this neighborhood in the last 15 years, hasn't made it out to where her sisters live. But around here, on Southport and on Clark and all over, there are little boutiques and several Starbucks and expensive restaurants with fake European names.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kay Frank</h4><p begin="00:26:58.44">The neighborhood has changed a lot, a whole lot. Some for the better, some for the worse. Close by we have our gay people, which we never had as a kid. They were around, maybe, but we didn't know who they were. Today, you know who they are. My husband, coming from the old school-- we have the nicest neighbors we've ever had, two gay men. They can't do enough for you, they cut your grass for you, they water it, now that I'm older. And when they moved in, my husband, coming from way back, oh my God, you know. He didn't want, really, too much to do with them.</p><p begin="00:27:54.65">Within a year, I'd say, we saw that they were nice people, very clean. And when we had our 50th wedding anniversary party, had some [UNINTELLIGIBLE] here, it was our neighbors that went to the hall, they wouldn't take a penny, they decorated that place like you wouldn't believe. Now, how many neighbors would do that for you? So gay or not gay, they're really nice people. So I think that the gays can be credited for being such a nice people. They swayed a lot of the old-time people into different thinking.</p><p begin="00:28:40.36">There's still a lot of racial stuff, maybe. If you had a black neighbor here, or one of the people would rent to a black person. I think that would be frowned upon a little bit. But if you rent to a gay person today, it's OK.</p><p begin="00:29:01.44">Maybe a lot of things that we think should be this way and that way as you grow up, it's really not that way, or shouldn't be that way. So I don't feel that we should really judge them. Let the Lord judge them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:27.06">Coming up, drunks, partiers, people on the make. And lots of other people to try not to judge. I mean, we have not even gotten to the cops. In a minute, from Public Radio International-- warm up that coffee for you-- when our program continues.</p></div>  </div>

If you're just tuning in, we tried to interview every person at every table of a 24-hour restaurant here in Chicago, starting at 5:00 AM in the morning on Friday, July 14, going until 5:00 AM the next morning. Not everybody said yes, not everybody could fit into a one-hour radio show, and the day is just heating up.</p><p begin="00:31:10.10">Let's jump ahead to midnight. One of the owners, Pete, is explaining something sort of surprising about a restaurant like this to our reporter Wendy Dorr.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pete</h4><p begin="00:31:18.78">We never close. We have no keys. We have no keys. If you see the doors, we have no locks. Always open. We never, never lock the doors.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:28.38">Just at that moment, a young woman bursts through the door. Laughing, she swivels around and drunkenly tries to lock it to keep her two friends out. It takes a second before she realizes there are no locks. The three stumble to a table.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kim</h4><p begin="00:31:40.53">This is Kim. I'm at The Golden Apple. I know I am. And I'm with Oscar and Beth. Oscar. Oscar, who I have no idea where he is. Beth and I are riding in the cab, and he like hops in. I've never even met this guy. I need to order food. I'm a journalism major, by the way. Yeah. So I understand what you're doing right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Beth</h4><p begin="00:32:12.84">I work with Kim. I don't live downtown. I live in the suburbs.

We just meet him standing at the bar. And he offers, he buys us a couple of shots. So we're like, fine. We started drinking with him, we start talking to him. Oh, so I'm sitting there, talking to Kim. All of a sudden, I feel two hands on my back, two hands I do not recognize, two hands that I do not want on my body. And I look, and who do I see?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Oscar</h4><p begin="00:33:00.25">[UNINTELLIGIBLE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Beth</h4><p begin="00:33:01.06">It is Oscar.

I will be honest with you. He paid for a lot of tonight. Like, he paid for my drinks. OK, great. You know what? Don't touch me, but you can buy my drinks for me. If you're going to hop into the cab and pay for it, then you know what? You're getting in the cab with me. That's fine. And he's probably going to buy our food here tonight.

Where am I, and what time is it? Well, I don't think I'm really here. I think that I'm doing a two-dimensional kind of thing. So there's part of me that's here, and then there's part of me that's somewhere else, the future me. So what time is it? Earthly time, it's 1:15 AM. And there is no time where my future self is.</p><p begin="00:35:35.31">You know how when you go to sleep and you dream how you can bend and shape the events that take place in that dream? Well, what if that were your reality, and what if this were the dream? You can actually paint your future and you can make everything that's ever happened, is happening, and will happen, has already happened. It's shape shifting time and events so that you know why your soul is here. And that's the purpose, to know why you're here, to know why you came back.</p><p begin="00:36:08.80">I know one past life, I was a cowboy. And I was shot by accident. And I've met two of my four buddies that I was with together here. We agreed to come back on some kind of subliminal basis. So yeah, I was a cowboy in one lifetime, probably right before the turn of the century. And my other lifetime, I really don't know, but I know I was crushed. And I don't know by what, but probably a large building. I haven't identified the time yet. I'm still working on that.</p><p begin="00:36:44.27">Can I have a short stack, please? That's all.

And so we kind of come here in hopes to find him. It hasn't worked yet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:37:32.45">You paged him and told him to come here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:37:34.00">Yeah, I paged him and told him to come here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:37:36.30">Paged him. No answer. Paged him again. No answer. Paged him again. No answer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:37:41.30">So basically, we have no life. So we come down here and wait for people. All right. Phone call time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:37:47.87">Do you have the number?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:37:48.96">Yeah, I have the number. All right, give me money. All right, I am calling this guy, Jeff. And I'm going to make him come here, because my best friend wants him to. All right. And it's still ringing.</p><p begin="00:38:06.39">Hi Jeff. We are at The Golden Apple. And I am wondering if you're at all coming because Allison kind of wants to see you, and I'm not going to stick around here all night because I have to sleep. So hopefully you'll be here by, like, 2:00. If not, call Allison tomorrow. All right. Bye. And he'll be here. He'll be here. Six messages on his machine at home.</p><p begin="00:38:44.30">I just called Jeff and told him that he's not here and he should be. And I still think he will come, I just don't know when.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:38:52.09">See, the thing that makes this a big deal is the fact that I think he actually might like me back, which doesn't happen ever, so that's why I want to see him again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:39:00.78">Hey, you want to know the really weird thing about us is she hates herself. She never likes anyone ever. And whenever anything goes right, she freaks out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:39:13.74">Seriously, you say that there's so many people that like me, but how many times has it actually ever worked out? It's not hard for you because you're just like this massive guy magnet. And you act sometimes like you don't see it. You see it. You've got to see it. Because we go somewhere and it's like, whoosh, and everyone's there by you. And not even just guys. Just people like you, you know? It takes no effort.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:39:36.95">But it's  not-- no, you're wrong, though.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:39:38.00">No, I'm not!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:39:38.29">Because it's not like I just get them like that. It's-- darr! OK, I'll give you sometimes. I don't know why, but sometimes it happens like that. And it's the fact that I talk and I'm not boring and I don't just sit there. No, I'm not saying you're boring. I'm just saying that that's what I'm not. People, like I said before, are robots. And they're going to want to follow the life of the party. That's how people are. If you put an idea in their head, like if one person says you're a good kisser, you are deemed a good kisser forever and ever and ever.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:40:11.89">That's the point. You have this thing where you just radiate positive vibes, you know? And you're always upbeat. When I've been really outgoing, or trying to be, I'm almost imitating you to see if it works. It doesn't work for me. And we're best friends, especially now that you live with me. It's like you're just always there, so the issue is always there. When you didn't live with me, sometimes I'm not even thinking about it, I don't care. But now you're there all the time. And we've been going out more. And it's always there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:40:51.95">It is 1:25 almost. OK. I am calling my friend Marion in hopes that he is up. OK. Marion? Are you sleeping? You are? We're just at the restaurant and waiting for people and no one's coming. So we were wondering do you want us to come pick up? Say yes. To come back here. Just say yes. No, say yes. So don't go to sleep. Oh, come on. You know you love me. Thank you. I will be there to pick you up in two minutes. Bye.</p><p begin="00:41:44.40">So we're here. Hi Marion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marion</h4><p begin="00:41:48.63">Hi. I can't go anywhere.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:41:50.42">Ha! You can't go anywhere? Get in the car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marion</h4><p begin="00:41:53.00">I cannot.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:41:54.29">Marion!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marion</h4><p begin="00:41:55.94">My mom has convinced me to stay.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:41:58.31">Marion, go tell her that you have to come back to the restaurant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Marion</h4><p begin="00:42:02.98">I can't. I have to wake up at 8:00 tomorrow morning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:42:05.93">Marion? I'm going to go beat you up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:09.90">Danielle, however, does not do such a good job convincing him with her fists. Actually, she doesn't try. He won't come. So she climbs back into the car to head back to meet Allison, who's waiting back at The Golden Apple.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:42:23.62">OK, me and Allison. I think that she feels like we're growing apart, because I've kind of been mean lately. Not like too mean, but-- she's my best friend, she will always be my best friend. It's just like now that we live together, we have constant each other. And it's just like we realize the things that we could overlook before are actual issues now.</p><p begin="00:42:54.68">Like, we're complete opposites. She doesn't like people, I love people. She likes staying home and reading. I can't stand staying home, and I can't stand reading. And I mean, I don't like thinking. It's like thinking is something you do in school and then when you need to. And she's not like that. And that's very cool. I mean, it shows that she's not a robot, or whatever.</p><p begin="00:43:21.69">But she's 17. She's only 17. And she acts like she's 23. She's, I guess, above the normal teenager. She thinks of things. She cares. And that's what people in college do. And that's what older people do. But me and most of all my friends, we're not ready. We don't want to do that. We want to just sit back and have fun. I mean, she just needs to find the right people to hang out with.</p><p begin="00:43:56.82">And for right now, it's not my thing. This is. This is my thing. I like this scene, where it's just like, we're going to sit back, we're going to have fun, we're going to laugh, we're just going to let everything go. Just like, all right. The Golden Apple scene. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:19.78">Once she's back in the restaurant, after all this thinking about how she and Allison are so different, she heads over to her best friend. They've started a band together called Mixed Emotions. It's just the two of them. Allison plays guitar, they both sing. And they do one of their songs together, now, for the microphone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:44:35.99">Ready? OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Both</h4><p begin="00:44:39.67">So much for faith, so much for loving you. So much for everything you told me you would do. So much for love, you won't believe in me. So much for all the times you say you'd never leave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:44:56.52">I needed you and thought you'd be there but now I see the change in you. And now you just don't seems to care.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Both</h4><p begin="00:45:13.08">So much for faith. So much for loving you. So much--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:18.49">They skooch in tight to each other near the mic as they sing, Allison sitting, Danielle standing, and leaning in close. And then the thing that they have been waiting for all night finally happened. Sort of.</p><p begin="00:45:29.58">[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:45:34.42">So this is Jeff. That's Juan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Billy</h4><p begin="00:45:36.63">He's got a face for radio.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:45:37.18">That's Billy. This is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:45:38.62">Oh, Billy's here!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:45:39.78">And it's 2:15 and they have finally arrived. Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:45:44.29">When we'd given up all hope, poof, they're here. It's the great--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:45:47.23">I told you. I knew it. I never gave up faith.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:50.30">They all sit down together. The guy who they've been waiting for, who they called six times, Jeff, he never arrived. But there is another Jeff with this group. And Allison transfers her crush to Jeff number two.</p><p begin="00:46:03.39">At some point, Danielle drags her outside the diner to confer. They stand on the sidewalk just on the other side of the plate glass window from Jeff number two and everybody else. Allison reviews the facts of the case.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:13.74">Well, it's just like OK. He's into some of the supernatural stuff too. And we have a lot of things in common. We're both big Tim Burton fans. And so-- I don't know. I actually had something to talk to him about for hours now. But then again, what's the point of liking him if he doesn't like me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:46:33.02">Do I ask him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:33.98">No!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:46:34.95">I'm just going to go and be like, OK, here, look. I'm trying to hook her up and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:38.51">Don't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:46:39.40">--hey, I was wondering. I'm trying to set Allison-- I'll be slick. It'll be fun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:44.54">For you, yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:46:45.93">I'll give him a flower. Come on, it'll be fun. If he says no, we just won't come out here ever again. Please?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Allison</h4><p begin="00:46:53.91">No!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:55.44">Whatever else it might do for Alison if she were hooked up with somebody, it might just reduce the general level of tension between her and Danielle. And Danielle does not take no for an answer. She gives the flower to Jeff number two, saying it's from Allison, he smiles a big number two smile, then he and Allison sit alone at a table and talk for a while until Danielle comes over.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:47:15.47">Are we leaving now? Yes, we paid. And we left the tip. And I put the rest of the change in this little box here.

They're not-- now there's two calls. Now it might be legitimate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Knudsen</h4><p begin="00:51:24.27">One thing that happens is when you get a regular partner, and even somebody who you can work with for the first night, you learn their first name, not just their last, and then where did you work before, are you married. He collects hockey cards. I collect monster memorabilia, models. I do model collecting. I collect a couple guitars. I play the guitar. And then other things.</p><p begin="00:51:46.35">But you create a bond. You'll even tell some intimate secrets, things that even the wives don't know about. But you're creating a bond. The people don't realize that. 90% of the job is you and your partner in the car. It can be a long night, or it can be a lot of fun.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark Eichman</h4><p begin="00:52:00.12">The other thing is if you don't feel like doing anything, on some nights, you don't have to. You might not get a call, you can chill out, drive around. You know, you'll just be off in a haze and it doesn't really matter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Knudsen</h4><p begin="00:52:16.08">It's almost 5:00, in the morning, AM, three more hours.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clark Eichman</h4><p begin="00:52:21.09">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Knudsen</h4><p begin="00:52:22.99">If we don't get a late arrest. 1-9-2-2 is back with you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:28.91">They head toward the door.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Norman Knudsen</h4><p begin="00:52:30.28">Donna?

Donna straightens things up a little, surveys the restaurant. She's the waitress that we first interviewed a full day before, the one who brings in cookies on Christmas for everybody. And she eyes the morning regulars at the tables.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna</h4><p begin="00:53:08.54">Well, it's now 5:00 Saturday morning. And I got one hour and 45 minutes. And I know it sounds a little corny, but I really do enjoy it. As soon as it starts to get daylight, I start to feel good. The day people come in, the nice smells, the nice colognes.</p><p begin="00:53:32.27">It's kind of wore off on the night people, but the day people, it's so fresh, it's nice, refreshing. Everybody else is getting sleepy and I'm starting to wake up because I'm a day person that's been working nights for 26 years. But I'm handling it all right.</p><p begin="00:54:10.01">[MUSIC - "EGGS AND SAUSAGE" BY TOM WAITS]</p></div>  </div>
