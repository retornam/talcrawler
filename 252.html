    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.29"> In Danielle's house, ever since she was a girl, when holiday dinners come, they serve a meal that will probably look familiar to you. Picture main course, big platter, drum sticks, white breast meat, golden brown skin, stuffing, and gravy, and cranberry relish on the side. And in Danielle's family they have a name for this meal that she told me on the phone recently.

And as you know, each week on our program we choose some theme, invite a variety of writers and performers to tackle that theme. And this week, as we stand now in that magical five weeks of the year, that magical five weeks between the turkey served at Thanksgiving and the turkey served at Christmas, a period when Americans consume nearly a fourth of all the turkey consumed in this country every year. And every year during this important time, <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> brings you yet another program about poultry. That's right-- stories about turkeys, chickens, ducks, fowl of all kind, and their mysterious hold over us.</p><p begin="00:01:40.42">I'm Ira Glass. Coming up this hour, Act One: Duki. The story of a typical American family and imaginary poultry.

In the late 1960s, the winged warrior struck terror in the hearts of evildoers on radios all across this great nation. Today, my friends, he flies again. Act Three: Chicken Diva. In that act, an opera about Chicken Little sung in Italian, and-- no kidding-- able to make a grown man cry. Act Four: Trying To Respect The Chicken. The story of one woman's quest to try to give chickens the honor and the dignity that they are rarely accorded, even though the chickens resist her efforts.</p><p begin="00:02:41.00">Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One. Duki.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:52.25"> Act One: Duki. So in Danielle's family, the power of poultry is so great in their lives that when they serve chicken or turkey, they call it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:03:01.95"> Fish.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:02.54"> That's right. And they call it this for a reason. And the reason has to do with a stuffed hand puppet called Duki.</p><p begin="00:03:10.13">Now, Danielle, is a woman over 30 years old. Her sister Ashley is two years younger. Duki has been in the family since they were children.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:03:17.60"> Well, he was a Christmas present when Ashley was about 8 and I was about 10. And when he first arrived, he was really fluffy. And he was this beautiful, fluffy, white duck. He had a cape on and black kind of villain slash hero goggles. He lost the outfit pretty quickly and he went naked. And then he became Ashley's vehicle for torturing me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:58.05"> It's not unusual for older siblings to dominate younger ones. And as children, Danielle dominated Ashley. Ashley looked up to Danielle, fought to get her attention and her approval, and Danielle always, always got her way. Except when Duki was around.</p><p begin="00:04:19.95">Basically, Ashley would channel-- I mean, the word's kind of an anachronism in this context-- but she would channel Duki. She would become Duki's voice. She would speak as Duki. And Duki was sarcastic. Duki was selfish and bossy. Duki would insult Danielle. Duki would tease Danielle. Duki would give her painful nose squeaks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:04:42.81"> Whenever Ashley brought Duki into the equation, he was completely the dominant force. I was just putty in Duki's hands.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:52.86"> Let me ask you to compare his personality with Ashley's personality.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:04:59.06"> Ashley is very kind of considerate, and-- she's very considerate and kind and thoughtful. And very, very sensitive to other people. Very, very concerned about if other people are happy and if someone or someone else doesn't feel good. And Duki has this total, like, you know, what's for lunch attitude. Like what's in it for me, in your face, totally out for himself. Simultaneously a braggart and a total wimp.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:30.25"> He's boastful and vain.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:05:32.23"> He's just this indomitable-- yeah-- indomitable spirit.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:47.19"> All right. I've been at Daniels apartment sometimes, and I've witnessed the following scene-- picture, please. Danielle has not spoken with her sister in weeks. She picks up the phone, calls Ashley in Michigan. Ashley answers. Danielle asks immediately, "can you put Duki on?"</p><p begin="00:06:07.30">And then Ashley essentially becomes Duki, puts Duki on the phone. Danielle talks to Duki for 15, 20 minutes. And then they both hang up. That's the whole conversation. And they both feel satisfied. These are adult-- Danielle is an editor at a big New York magazine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:06:30.00"> I adore Duki. I really love Duki. And sometimes I think if he disappeared, it would really feel like someone died. I mean, I look at him and he looks really kind of old and ratty, and it really makes me sad. I feel like-- it sounds crazy. It really makes me sad to think about a world without Duki. And that it would be a big empty hole the world.</p><p begin="00:06:56.74">He kind of takes up as much room in my heart as a lot of people individually. And if something happened to him, you know, if he were lost at an airport or run over by a car, it would really be heartbreaking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:18.07"> So I hope it's becoming clear why, if you eat dinner in the home of Danielle's family, if they're serving some kind of poultry-- you know, chicken or turkey-- if you were to ask anybody in the family, "what's for dinner," they'll tell you--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:07:30.59"> Fish.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:31.08"> Right. And the rationale for that is what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:07:34.93"> It freaks Duki out.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:36.13"> It freaks him out, though-- you don't like him to know that perhaps some birds are, in fact, eaten?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:07:42.74"> I think he knows. I think he's in denial about it. He's in denial about most things. He's in denial about the fact that he's totally weak and tiny and dirty. He thinks he's really good looking and strong. And that he's really smart and has a lot of friends.</p><p begin="00:08:02.30">He's in denial about the fact that he's actually stuffed, which he is. Sometimes I tell him, and I say, "Duki, give me a break-- you're just stuffed." And he's like, "no way."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:24.11"> Now, I thought I would try to book Duki to come on the radio for this program. So I contacted Danielle's sister Ashley and asked her, you know, "could Duki come on the air?" I received an answer back not by phone, but by electronic mail that for Duki to appear, I'd have to first go through someone named Yona Lu, who I could reach through Danielle and Ashley's mother. And when I talked to Danielle, I asked her about this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:51.43"> I've been informed that the only way that I can reach him is by calling your mom and speaking to Yona Lu? Do I have that name right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:08:58.58"> Yona Lu, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:59.78"> Yona Lu.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:09:00.24"> I think that's-- she's acting as his agent.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:02.51"> Yona Lu is?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:09:03.84"> She's a hedgehog.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:07.94"> Anything special that I should say to Yona Lu to make this happen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:09:13.19"> I mean, I don't know.

As you might imagine, not everybody in the family takes all this so lightly.

That period that you're describing, when do you mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Mattoon</h4><p begin="00:12:03.62"> I would say they maybe were 10 and 12 or 9 and 11.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:06.82"> And they would only communicate through the duck?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Mattoon</h4><p begin="00:12:09.55"> Well, Danielle didn't pay a whole lot of attention to Ashley, but she paid quite a lot of attention to the duck. So if Ashley wanted to get Danielle's attention, all she had to do was rev up the duck.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:29.87"> And how long did this last?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mrs. Mattoon</h4><p begin="00:12:34.67"> I can't remember. She'd also make Danielle laugh that way. Danielle thought Duki was very funny, but I can't remember her thinking Ashley was funny.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:12:46.88"> In terms of the relationship between my sister and me, I don't know why-- I mean, this is probably completely, really sick-- but I have so much genuine affection and love for Duki that it's very easy, and it's very easy to demonstrate those feelings, in a way that it's not as easy to kind of demonstrate those feelings toward my sister. Just because we never got in the habit of it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:13.19"> What percentage of your relationship with your sister is based on your relationship with Duki?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Danielle</h4><p begin="00:13:18.44"> Well, the really fun part of it is based on my relationship with Duki. But I think as we've gotten older and older, we've gotten more and more self-conscious about the Duki factor in our relationship. But I think kind of a big chunk. I mean, it definitely kind of gives me this vision into her brain that I wouldn't have otherwise.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:49.23"> Well, I did finally snag an interview with Duki by calling Ashley.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:56.69"> Is Duki still up for this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ashley</h4><p begin="00:13:58.78"> Yeah.

You've got a whole bunch of celebrities on tonight?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:37.42"> Well, we actually have a number of different people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:14:39.87"> [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] like Tom Cruise?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:43.52"> They're just like Tom Cruise.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:14:46.14"> OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:47.80"> Now, Duki, I was talking to Danielle for our radio program and had her come on and talk about you a little bit. And one of the things that she said was that when she was younger, in order to discipline her if she was doing something that you didn't like, you could pretty much control her with something called nose squeaks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:15:03.99"> Yeah. Because she has this kind of-- it's a prominent nose, you know what I mean? Kind of sticks out and you just want to squeak it. You know, like, over Thanksgiving we were watching <i>The</i> <i>Muppet</i> <i>Show.</i> And Miss Piggy was on, and she reminded me a lot of Niellie.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:19.26"> Of Danielle?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:15:20.25"> Mm-hm. [AFFIRMATIVE] Yeah. And Kermit told Miss Piggy, "move the pork." And so I was telling Niellie to move the pork all week.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:27.18"> And would she move?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:15:28.46"> Yes, she would. She would.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:30.67"> Now, if Ashley would tell her, if Ashley would sit down on the couch and say to Danielle, "move the pork," what would the effect of that be?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:15:39.74"> Kind of-- you know Niellie. You know how she looks at you when she doesn't approve of something you say or do. She gets this kind of ice-cold stare and she gives you this sidelong glance that makes you kind of feel like you're about the size of a pea.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:57.55"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:15:58.11"> That's what she does.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:01.37"> Is there anything about the life of a duck that perhaps you could tell our radio audience that we might not know? I'm sure that you know much more about it than we do.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:16:10.75"> No, not really. I'm kind of an unusual duck. I'm not really in touch with the whole duck scene.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:17.85"> You're not in touch with the whole scene, yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Duki</h4><p begin="00:16:20.36"> When I had time, I used to migrate once in a while because I have some friends who are ducks. And I try to keep in touch with them, but lately I just started spending more time with people and doing my own thing. And I just don't have time to do those kind of duck things anymore.

  <h3>Act Three. Chicken Diva.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:25:41.81"> Oddly enough, it wasn't Susan who was obsessed with chickens, it was Kenny, a pal who worked backstage at the 92nd Street Y in New York. His house was filled with chicken cups, chicken masks. He got the whole staff onto chickens, including Susan. For a time there in the 80s, poultry-related jokes and references became the fast way to get a laugh at the Y.</p><p begin="00:26:03.06">I guess most of us are condemned to see nothing more than the easy comedy of chickens, but Susan Vitucci saw something else-- their potential greatness, their hidden beauty, their grandeur. One day she glued together some finger puppets for a 10 minute rendition of the Chicken Little story for her nephew. That was 14 years ago. Today it is a full length opera enjoyed by a cult following whenever it goes up in a workshop or cafe or small theater.</p><p begin="00:26:30.64">It's still performed with finger puppets, but now it has a complete score written by a noted composer, Henry Krieger, who did <i>Dreamgirls.</i> The Chicken Little opera he wrote with Susan Vitucci is called <i>Love's</i> <i>Fowl.</i> Needless to say, that's F-O-W-L.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Henry Krieger</h4><p begin="00:26:46.94"> Well, we were going to start with the opening, Siamo del Teatro Repertorio delle Mollette. We are the Clothespin Repertory Theater, and we have a special singing guest for you, which I don't know--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:26:59.90"> Susan and I are sitting at Henry's baby grand piano.

Because once Toby gets going, he actually harmonizes with Henry and Susan.</p><p begin="00:27:19.84">[MUSIC - HENRY KRIEGER AND SUSAN VITUCCI SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p><p begin="00:27:23.78">[DOG WHINING AND HOWLING TO MUSIC]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:27:41.89"> You may have noticed that this libretto is in Italian, just like a real opera.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:27:46.13"> Before, it was just a bunch of puppets in a box, you know, with a good idea. And then suddenly, as soon as it went into Italian, it became something bigger than what it had been. And it's because when it's in English, we all kind of know it and it's really not that interesting. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. As soon as it's in Italian, it gives us enough distance that we can come in. You know, it makes us-- it's like the lover who doesn't want you. You don't want anybody more than you want the one who doesn't want you. Right? And so it's sort of the same thing.</p><p begin="00:28:21.39">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:28:46.33"> You may recall that when you last heard of Little, back in kindergarten, she was just an average barn door fowl who had an acorn drop on her head, which she mistakenly understood to be the sky falling. Her alarms excited her friends, Goosey Loosey, Turkey Lurkey, and Ducky Lucky. And they join her for a journey to the king to tell him the important news. On the way, they meet up with Sly Fox. Little's pals eagerly accept his invitation for dinner, literally, as it turns out. Fortunately for Little, hunger is not enough to distract her from her mission, and she tracks on.</p><p begin="00:29:19.16">When she meets the king, he tells her that the sky's not falling-- it's just an acorn. So the enlightened Chicken Little returns to her coop, and that's where the story ends. What are we to take away from Little's experience? I like to think it's that Little is rewarded with life, precisely because she went off on this Quixotic mission, totally in the grip of a wrong idea.</p><p begin="00:29:42.46">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:29:56.95"> The children's fable barely figures into the story. It's just one small episode in the life of Chicken Little, now known as La Pulcina Piccola. After the acorn incident, she goes on to become an internationally renowned figure in almost every field imaginable, a diva of politics, academe, theater, art, daring-do. Like Venus, she arrives from some other world, transported on a scallop shell.</p><p begin="00:30:20.98">But the triumphs of her life began after a youthful love affair with a fighting cock ends bitterly, and she consoles herself, as we all do at some point in our lives, by plunging into Shakespeare. She becomes an overnight sensation as an actress, celebrated all over the world for one role. Juliet? Cleopatra? Ophelia?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:30:39.95"> The company then performs an excerpt of a recreation of her signature role, which is Richard III. Well, you know, I mean, Sarah Bernhardt did Hamlet.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:30:55.40"> Well, there's a great tradition of women playing the men's roles in Shakespeare, but I think Richard III is one of the more rare roles to be played by a woman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:31:03.39"> Well, that's how adventuresome an actress this chicken was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:31:13.16"> I can assure you there's nothing like watching a four inch tall finger puppet crying out, "a horse, a horse-- my kingdom for a horse" in Italian. Not to mention that that puppet is a chicken, surrounded by a whole supporting cast of poultry and other avian supernumeraries. Susan says that, artistically, there's something special about chickens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:31:34.13"> They're a clean slate. You can put anything on them. You can project anything onto them. Because it's not like they have, to me, at least, a very strong personality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:31:45.57"> Except for La Pulcina. In the opera, she moves into the field of archaeology, masters it, needless to say, and makes a great discovery-- the last tomb of Gallapatra. But not before she sails the seven seas, is ship wrecked, gets rescued-- but it's by pirates-- and then she meets the pirate king.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:32:04.71"> As soon as he meets her, he falls in love with her, because of her sweet spirit. Because she comes in and she says, "here you see a little chicken who, although I'm dripping wet, I'm proud and yellow."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:32:18.58"> Let me repeat that lyric for you in a purer translation. "Although I stand before you, a chicken, who is dripping wet, I am proud and I am yellow." OK. Back to Susan.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:32:31.33"> "And although I've loved and I have lost, I have learned to follow the call of adventure. So let's sail on.</p><p begin="00:32:39.23">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:32:56.05"> Keep in mind that all of the action-- like everything that occurs in every Susan Vitucci production, ever since the first one for her nephew, and continuing to this day-- occurs among characters created by sticking a small painted Styrofoam ball onto a larger painted Styrofoam ball, poking in two map tacks for eyes, gluing on a tiny felt beak, and then impaling the whole thing on top of one of those really old fashioned clothes pins that a forties cartoon figure would clamp to his nose around a chunk of Limburger cheese.</p><p begin="00:33:28.54">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:33:51.35"> And I could go on.</p><p begin="00:33:53.19">Susan has written, or she puts it, "translated" La Pulcina Piccola's diaries, which detail the other adventures that happened in between those in the opera. There are 60 pages so far, excerpts of which have appeared in <i>Clothes</i> <i>Lines,</i> the official fan club newsletter of the opera.</p><p begin="00:34:09.93"><i>Love's</i> <i>Fowl</i> has a strange effect on people. I didn't understand until Susan loaned me a videotape of one performance. To be honest, I thought I would be annoyed at the intentional irony and hokiness of the puppets. But there I was with my three year old daughter, who loved the show, watching a plastic bird pantomime one of the simplest human moments, but also one of the most profound-- the confession of a great love. In this case, with a cock robin.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:34:36.36"> The song that she sings as she enters goes, "I am a chicken and ready for love. My heart is as fragile as the egg from which I was born. Treat me gently, and so will I treat you. Together from earthly love, we will reach for the divine." And then she sings, "I am a chicken, and I can't fly without love. My heart, it is as strong as the egg from which I was born." And so forth.</p><p begin="00:35:02.23">And so it is only with Cock Robin that she flies.</p><p begin="00:35:07.10">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:35:31.36"> And after they've agreed to fly together, and they're soaring in the air, Cock Robin is shot and killed, murdered by a jealous sparrow. I couldn't believe it, but I was getting choked up, especially when Cock Robin appeared on the stage, his Styrofoam body spray painted black for the lament, has little magic marker eyes drawn as x's. I gathered my daughter in my arms and held on tight, as I was helplessly drawn into an expression of the grief and suffering of this little sad bird.</p><p begin="00:35:58.89">In this era of slick special effects, there was something unexpectedly liberating in the marriage of this crude medium-- painted Styrofoam balls bobbing up and down behind a cardboard box-- and the high melodramatic art of Italian opera. Picture it.</p><p begin="00:36:15.05">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:36:48.45"> I want a subscription to that newsletter.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:36:51.14"> Are you going to do this? I mean, are you going to be working with Pulcina Piccola, you think, for the rest of your life?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Susan Vitucci</h4><p begin="00:36:57.15"> It's possible. And I like working with her because I get to go into a world that's inhabited by a very sweet spirit. And play with the mechanics of the world.</p><p begin="00:37:10.91">And because it's very small-- I could never have afforded to produce this show with people. But I could afford to do it with clothespins. So I can do as big a production as I want with clothespins. I can have stuff fly in and out and come in from traps, and I can have all kinds of fancy, flashy stuff that costs millions of dollars to do on Broadway. And it costs me $200 because I had to buy lots and lots of Styrofoam and clothespins and stuff, and all this, and a new table maybe. And I get to do whatever I want.</p><p begin="00:37:46.57">[SINGING IN ITALIAN]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:58.16"> Jack Hitt is a writer who lives in New Haven.</p><p begin="00:38:02.40">[MUSIC - "FINGER LICKIN' GOOD" BY THE BEASTIE BOYS]</p></div>  </div>

And even in this goofy, un-bird-like situation, an hour of watching them makes clear just how hard it is to ever get birds to hit the standard. Which is to say not only do we completely dominate every aspect of the lives of chickens-- their births, their feed, their eggs, their slaughter-- not only have we bred them to human specifications to meet human needs, but we have created a standard for what it means to be a chicken that most chickens can never meet. That's what the standard means. We judge them as chickens, and we find them lacking. If they had brains to understand this, they would be right to feel indignant.</p><p begin="00:47:58.07">But of course, this is a city person's perspective, and that means it is completely wrong-headed from the point of view of anybody who actually raises birds. Standing in the cold feed room, I had a long, long talk with George about this. George is 80 years old. He's been raising birds since the-- I guess the Calvin Coolidge administration. And he says the whole fun of raising birds is raising them to the standard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Cairns</h4><p begin="00:48:20.56"> Well, like, for instance, if your birds lack bone, OK, you go out and buy a bird as near to like them as you can with better bone. But when you mate them together, you might get long-legged birds, or too short. I mean, you don't get what you want just by mating. It takes four or five years to gradually get it out, and by that time, they're inbred and you need new ones.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:52.34"> George tells me that when he's breeding a new batch of birds, he'll hatch 65 of them, and only one or two will be anywhere near the <i>Standard</i> <i>of</i> <i>Perfection.</i> That's how hard it is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:01.67"> Do you get frustrated with the <i>Standard</i> <i>Of</i> <i>Protection</i> sometimes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Cairns</h4><p begin="00:49:04.64"> No, we get frustrated with the judges. Because every judge has his own idea of what the standard should be.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:12.11"> I thought that's the whole point of a standard, is that--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Cairns</h4><p begin="00:49:14.18"> That is. But one judge will want it this way, and another another. Today, if you bred your birds to the standard of perfection-- weight and everything-- and took them to the show, you probably wouldn't get anywhere. You've got to breed to the fads.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:33.00"> That's right. The fads. Like Cornishes these days are supposed to have shorter legs than the real <i>Standard</i> <i>of</i> <i>Perfection.</i> Vertical tail feathers are out in all sorts of breeds that really should have them. In the country, among the chicken breeders, they think about a lot of things you never get to in the city.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:52.70"> And when you're raising these birds, with any of these birds, do you have a close relationship with a bird the way some do [UNINTELLIGIBLE] with a pet?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Cairns</h4><p begin="00:50:01.88"> I don't have time. Yeah, I got too many things to do. See, a few years ago, I almost died of cancer, and the Good Lord told me how to cure myself. And so I've been working with that a lot the last three years.

You're saying that you were diagnosed with cancer, and this is the only treatment you've had, and it cured you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Cairns</h4><p begin="00:50:43.50"> Yeah.

No doctor has actually checked him out to prove the cancer is gone from his body.

And it has cut into his bird breeding a bit.</p><p begin="00:51:23.20">George leaves, off on other business. Tamara is finished hanging and lighting the next backdrop.
