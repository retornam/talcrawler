  <h3>Prologue.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.33">In 1853 during the California Gold Rush, a leafleteer out west published the Ten Commandments for Gold Miners who had come out to prospect. Commandment number four in the traditional Ten Commandments tells you to observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Commandment number four reads like this, "Thou shalt not remember what thy friends do at home on the Sabbath day, lest the remembrance may not compare favorably with what thou doest here."

  <h3>Commandments One, Two, And Three. Honor God.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:24.21">Different denominations attach different numbering schemes to the Commandments, to which commandment goes with which number, though the commandments are always the same. But however you count them, the first two or three commandments, they cover the same ground. They're all about acknowledging God. "I'm the Lord your God. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not carve idols and bow down to them and worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain."</p><p begin="00:04:50.38">These commandments in particular are ones that Shalom Auslander tried to understand and obey as a boy going to religious school, a yeshiva, a school where they were drilled in all of the Bible's commandments by teachers who could be pretty intimidating, some more than others. Here's Shalom.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shalom Auslander</h4><p begin="00:05:05.33">Eli said that his big brother said that Rabbi Breyer once broke a student's nose by slapping the student's face. Dov said that his big brother said that Rabbi Breyer had once broken a student's arm when he was dragging the student from the room for talking during prayers. Rabbi Breyer was the scariest rabbi in the whole yeshiva.</p><p begin="00:05:31.59">He was a stocky man, wide as the doorway, with a long, rough beard and thick, angry hands, and everyone trembled that first day of third grade when he stomped heavily into the classroom, wrote his name on the blackboard, and shouted at Akiva for slouching in his seat. Nobody spoke during class. Nobody doodled in the margins of their prayer books. And when, at the end of the first test at the end of the first week, Rabbi Breyer shouted, "Pencils down," it was as if the commandment had come from God himself.</p><p begin="00:06:10.07">At recess, we stood huddled together on the concrete slab beside the door, afraid to play, worried that Breyer was somewhere watching. Avi and Eli started flipping baseball cards. Flipping cards is considered gambling, which is forbidden, so we were supposed to return the cards to each other at the end of recess. Nobody ever did. Eli won a large stack of cards from Avi, and I flipped Eli next. I lost an old Willie Randolph and a frayed Lou Piniella, but I won a mint Carl Yastrzemski, whom I was pretty sure was Jewish. I had been trying to win him for months.</p><p begin="00:06:51.65">The bell rang and everyone headed glumly back to class, where we sat quietly at our desks, waiting for Rabbi Breyer to return. I took out my Carl Yastrzemski, turned it over, and carefully wrote my name across the back. I didn't want to lose him and didn't plan on flipping him.</p><p begin="00:07:08.63">"Name of the creator," Rabbi Breyer shouted. I jumped, and turned to find him standing beside me, his face red, his furious finger pointing at the baseball card on my desk. "Name of the creator," he shouted again. He grabbed the card from my desk. Name of the creator? I was confused. Yaz? Rabbi Breyer slapped my hand, grabbed me by the ear, and led me to the head of the classroom. He held Yastrzemski over his head and shook him. "This," he declared loudly, "must never be thrown away. It must never touch the ground. It must never be covered." Then Rabbi Breyer waved the card in my face and told me that my name was the same name as God's, and I must never write it again.</p><p begin="00:08:06.45">The Jewish God has 72 names, and even though I was only eight years old, I already knew a lot of them. There was Adonai, there was Yahweh, there was Elohim. There was He Who is Full of Mercy, He Who is Quick to Anger, the Holy Spirit, the Divine Presence, the Rock, the Savior, and now, somewhere near the bottom of the list, there was Shalom. Peace. My name.</p><p begin="00:08:39.73">Rabbi Breyer handed me the baseball card, and told me to take it to the prayer hall upstairs and immediately put it in the Shaimos Box. Shaimos means "names," and it was the place where any old or unusable names of God are left to be discarded. Pages from prayer books, crumbling Talmuds, old Torah scrolls, and from now on, anything I wrote my name on. When the box was filled, the rabbis would take it outside, dig a hole, and bury the pages in the ground. From now on, Rabbi Breyer said, when writing my name I was to replace the last Hebrew letter, the M sound, with a simple apostrophe. I was no longer Shalom. I was Shalo'. I headed upstairs with a sigh.</p><p begin="00:09:30.68">Life with God's name was more difficult than I imagined. I was annoyed with God for being so selfish with them all. He had 71 other names. I couldn't see why he'd mind so much if I used just one. I didn't want to tell God how to do his job, but I wondered if maybe there weren't bigger things for him to be worrying about than who was using one of his six dozen names without permission. Isn't this, I wondered, what led to holocausts?</p><p begin="00:10:00.04">The Shaimos Box in the prayer hall filled quickly: my homework, my test papers, my what-I-did-this-summer, even my <i>Highlights</i> <i>For</i> <i>Children.</i> And buried at the bottom of the box, a pair of underpants my mother had written my name on with permanent marker.</p><p begin="00:10:16.21">It seemed I couldn't go an hour without making something holy, and I wasn't the only one. Every morning my mother wrote my name on my lunch bag, the name of God, in bright red magic marker, with a quickly drawn smiley face just below it. And every afternoon, Rabbi Breyer would grab my lunch bag, shout, "Name of the creator," dump the food out onto my desk, and send me upstairs to the Shaimos Box with my suddenly sacred lunch bag.</p><p begin="00:10:45.95">It didn't end with writing. I was standing at the urinal one day when Avi came in. "Hey Shalom," he said. "Name of the creator," Rabbi Breyer shouted from inside the nearby stall. "Name of the creator." We heard him fumbling with his pants and ran back to class. Later, as we sat with our heads down as punishment, Rabbi Breyer explained that speaking God's name in the bathroom was also forbidden.</p><p begin="00:11:10.52">And then a few weeks later, it suddenly all clicked. I began spelling my name with an apostrophe without even thinking. My mother stopped writing my name on my lunch bag, and my friends stopped saying "hello" to me in the bathroom. It had been a hassle at the beginning, but now the whole God thing was growing on me. My classmates were named after rabbis and forefathers. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob? Please. I was named after God.</p><p begin="00:11:38.83">So I was surprised a few days later when I heard Rabbi Breyer in the middle of an exam on the first chapter of Genesis shout, "Name of the creator." I turned around, expecting to see him standing beside me, but he was on the far side of the classroom standing behind Shlomo's desk, pointing a furious finger at Shlomo's test paper. "Name of the creator," he shouted again, and he slapped Shlomo's hand, grabbed him by the ear, and dragged him to the front of the class.</p><p begin="00:12:07.03">Shlomo isn't technically a name of God, but it means "his shalom," his peace, and for some reason that day Rabbi Breyer decided that was close enough. But instead of feeling relieved that someone else in our classroom would share the burden of a holy name, I was disappointed. It was a pain in the ass being named God, but it was my pain and it was my ass.</p><p begin="00:12:34.21">Rabbi Breyer handed Shlomo his test paper, and told me to take him upstairs to show him where the Shaimos Box was. I still didn't quite understand God's reasoning behind the third commandment of "Thou shall not use my name in vain," but I suddenly had a pretty good idea of the reason behind the first, "Thou shall have no other gods besides me." It's one thing to be the only God. It's quite another lesser thing to be one of two.</p><p begin="00:13:08.28">I headed upstairs with Shlomo two steps behind me. I wanted to push him down the stairs. I wanted to shove him out the window. As we walked toward the prayer hall, I remembered that Rabbi Breyer had told us that Moses had killed an Egyptian by uttering the name of God. Shlomo pushed his way in front of me and hurried to the Shaimos Box. "Adonai," I whispered. Nothing. "Yahweh," I said. Nothing.</p><p begin="00:13:40.55">I couldn't bear to watch him violating my Shaimos Box, so I turned and headed back to class, Shlomo running behind me, trying to keep up, using my name in vain and calling, "Shalom, Shalom, wait up," as I squeezed my eyes shut and whispered one last time, "Elohim." Nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:12.83">Shalom Auslander.

  <h3>Commandment Five. Honor Your Father And Your Mother.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:56.34">If you're just tuning in, we are devoting our show today to The Ten Commandments. We are at commandment number five right now, "Honor your father and your mother."</p><p begin="00:18:03.45">When he was 11 in Charleston, South Carolina, Jack Hitt and his friends back then formed a little club where they would hang out at this one backyard that was all overgrown, and which they thought of at the time as a jungle. It had a big brick wall along one side. They started doing things that did not honor their fathers and their mothers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:18:22.57">Anyway, we had we declared it to be our land. We were squatters. And so we started painting things on the wall. One of us painted a naked woman, and one of us wrote his name and then "loves" and then the girl he had a thing for that time. And that's how he got caught because he wrote his name on the wall. And then I wrote all these bad words. I just wrote every bad word I could think of.</p><p begin="00:18:49.34">And so I came home one day, and the police came to my house and told my parents, or called my father at work or something. Anyway, he came home early from work. He sat me down in his big study and said, "I understand you've painted some words on a wall." And I was like, oh my God, just burst into tears. I was just beyond control. My father never cursed, at least not in front of us and he was very strict about language.</p><p begin="00:19:22.52">And so he asked me what words we painted-- I painted on the wall. I think I choked out, "H-E-double hockey sticks" or something. He kind of looked down, very grave indeed. "Anything else?" I was like, "Yeah." That was just the warm-up. And so then I said, "I painted the other words. I can't say them. I can't say them." And then he said, "Tell me what it started with." He was going to get it out of me. I coughed up the letter S. He was just-- his eyes blazed, and he bowed his head, "Oh my God. Anything else?" I could not be contained. I was wailing around on the sofa. I said, "There's only one word left, and yeah, I painted it." And he was just-- I think he was actually thunderstruck. And then he sat there in silence for a few minutes. And then he looked up at me, and he said-- [SIGH] He said [SIGH].</p><p begin="00:20:31.95">Now you have to understand, my father comes from the rural area, marries the southern belle in Charleston, South Carolina. It was a marriage of two kinds of families in the South. And he said, "Son, I've worked all my life to make sure that when you or your sisters or your brother walk down the street people say, 'There goes a Hitt. They're good people.' I don't think anything that anybody in this family has done has damaged that reputation as much as you have today." He said, "That is your punishment. You may go now."</p><p begin="00:21:16.75">I was 11. I was floored. I asked him, I think, to spank me, because of course part of me wanted an explosion that would end it. But he said when he dismissed me from the room, he said, "This has been your punishment." And then of course a couple of months later he dies. That's one of my last memories, is him telling me that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:46.22">Do you think he was being sincere?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:21:49.09">Well I'll tell you, years later we had a little family reunion. I might have been 20. I was in college. All my siblings got together. They were all married at this point. We dismissed all the in-laws to go see the movies, and the five of us stayed up really late talking. I don't think we had ever really talked about our father in any deep way since he had died.</p><p begin="00:22:17.50">I started telling that story. I had never told that story, because I was ashamed of it. It was the black mark on the family that I had done this. I couldn't bring-- I'd never told anybody that story. I started telling that story, and all my sisters start wailing with laughter, and then they all start telling the story that what they had done that had prompted essentially the exact same speech. Like one of them had been caught shoplifting in Atlanta, and he had to fly there and get her. It was just a terrible story. I'd never heard that one before either. I thought hoo-ee, painting a few bad words on a wall, that's nothing compared to shoplifting in Atlanta.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:01.92">And was this the first time that everybody else was realizing that he had said the speech to them too? Or were you the only one who didn't know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:23:10.57">I think I was the only one who didn't know. I mean, they're much older than I am. I'm a mistake. My oldest sister is 16 years older than I am. So I think what was kind of moving about that whole encounter was that all of them had long ago forgotten their particular crime that had prompted daddy to give them the big reputation speech. But when I brought it up, it suddenly-- for all of them that all flooded back. It just created this great little moment where we all suddenly realized we were-- the whole family was just so defined by my father's rather Baptist sense of morality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:46.48">Jack Hitt is a contributing editor to our show.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Commandment Six. You Shall Not Murder.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:53.30">Well the Sixth Commandment seems like it could not be more straightforward: "Thou shalt not kill." But of course even this is one that is not always so simple to know how to obey.</p><p begin="00:24:01.85">Army Reserve Chaplain Lieutenant Colonel Lyn Brown is back in this country from Iraq, where he has served two tours. When he was in Iraq, he would run services for his unit once a week, but most of his ministry was just talking to guys one on one. The main issue they have, he says, is about missing their families, but often they talk to him about killing. He spoke with one of our producers, Alex Blumberg.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyn Brown</h4><p begin="00:24:22.35">I did meet with one soldier on several occasions to just work through the Commandment. This young man had actually, along with another soldier, had gone forward when the vehicle in front of them had been blown up to hold the hand of a soldier who was not going to survive. Somebody had told me that he was having a tough time.</p><p begin="00:24:52.22">So I went over to him, and I just said, "What are you thinking?" He said, "I never thought about the killing that would be going on." When you're firing at a target to practice, you think of those things as targets, not as people. For him to be there and to see that he had some buddies that were on the receiving end, he was just saying, The Ten Commandments and the Bible says, "Thou shalt not kill." And he says, "I'm not certain I can go out and kill."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:25:31.35">His concern was that like God wouldn't forgive him, or that it was wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyn Brown</h4><p begin="00:25:39.25">Well it was that God wouldn't approve of him doing that. And he also brought up if you were to do it, who could he tell? Because he said, "I wouldn't want to tell my girlfriend about this. I wouldn't want to tell my children." And that's why I went ahead and had a little Bible study with him.</p><p begin="00:26:04.22">It was a kind of thing that I did meet with him on several occasions to find out what God had to say about war, and where did the commandment "thou shalt not kill," where did that come in? But also to work through other instances where, for example in the New Testament, where Jesus meets an army officer who has a child who's dying. He asks Jesus if he would heal his daughter. But the interesting thing I would point out is that Jesus never condemned the soldier for his job.</p><p begin="00:26:45.88">I also know that when King David wanted to build a temple, that God said no. He said, your son's going to do it because you're a man of blood. So there's a lot of controversy, as you can imagine, as to trying to interpret what God was talking about there. And of course that seems to reflect on even my role as a chaplain. Why am I wearing an Army uniform and trying to deal with people who are out to kill people?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:27:14.40">Are there times that you feel that faith and the US military are sort of at odds?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyn Brown</h4><p begin="00:27:21.96">Yes. We preach the love of God and the fact that we ought to be at peace with each other. In the same time, I'm wearing a uniform that says US Army on it. I'm there to support them in their mission of winning a war and that means taking lives. So I do wrestle with that. There's times that you just kind of go, "God, can I resign here? Can I get away from this?" Rather than having to deal with the questioning that people have, and often not having answers.</p><p begin="00:27:56.65">I think that's probably the biggest challenge that I've ever had, was I couldn't just say, "Just think this way and you'll be fine." There were times that they were asking the same questions that I would be asking.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:28:10.16">Such as?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyn Brown</h4><p begin="00:28:11.82">Well, should we be here? Should we be killing people?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alex Blumberg</h4><p begin="00:28:18.14">Do you think that you have a different understanding of this particular Commandment, the Fifth Commandment, "Thou shalt not kill." Do you feel like you have a different understanding of it after serving in Iraq than perhaps somebody who didn't serve?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lyn Brown</h4><p begin="00:28:37.18">I think I'm much more hesitant about having a definite opinion about who should die. Just seeing the brutality and the-- people have got body parts missing, or there's big holes. They died a violent death. It's not pretty. It just doesn't seem normal, which it isn't.</p><p begin="00:29:05.74">But also even with the Iraqi culture, there were times that people just said, whatever group it was they didn't agree with, they just said, [SHOOTING SOUND] kill them all. I was going uh, these are people. I didn't like that attitude. And then I was seeing it even among the armed forces. There was people that would just kind of say, well we just need to kill them all, and then that will take care of it. I was going, "whoa." Who nominated you to be God?</p><p begin="00:29:40.89">We all have a tendency to interpret the Ten Commandments in a way that's convenient for us. There's the interpretation of thou shalt not murder. It shouldn't be a premeditated killing. It has nothing to do with war. Those kinds of things. But it just makes me-- I'm looking at it as a principle that God says, you need to value life, and don't take it lightly. Just don't condemn people to death just because it's easy to do.

  <h3>Commandment Seven. You Shall Not Commit Adultery.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:40.23">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our show, of course, we choose a theme. We bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show: The Ten Commandments. We're doing one story for each of the Commandments. The first few commandments, of course, about how to relate to God. Then there's one on relating to your parents, and the rest are all direct injunctions about how to act, basically a list of things that you are not supposed to do. We are at commandment number seven, "You shall not commit adultery." Yes, we are at the commandment that is about sex, and while there is going to be nothing explicit in this next story, it does acknowledge the existence of sex. A little warning there.</p><p begin="00:32:16.76">In 1976 in an interview with <i>Playboy</i> magazine, then-presidential candidate Jimmy Carter admitted kind of famously that he had committed adultery in his heart many times, meaning of course that he had had lustful thoughts. There's this thing that Jesus says in the book of Matthew, "Whoever looks at a woman lustfully has committed adultery in his heart." Dave Dickerson grew up going to an evangelical church in Tucson, Arizona, and he remembers hearing about what Carter said about committing adultery in his heart.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:32:42.94">I was eight years old, and I knew just what he was talking about. He was just saying the same thing I had read in my Bible dozens of times. As an evangelical Christian, I wanted desperately to please God, so for my entire adolescence and up into my twenties I literally tried to avoid having lustful thoughts. I was taught this was possible. Paul says in Second Corinthians that we take every thought captive in the name of Jesus, which means that any spiritually healthy person ought to able to control every thought in his head.</p><p begin="00:33:11.70">Of course, in practice this is even harder than it sounds. So for young evangelicals like me, there's a whole sub-industry of sex advice columns and books with titles like <i>Every</i> <i>Man's</i> <i>Struggle</i> or <i>Taking</i> <i>Thoughts</i> <i>Captive.</i> You can find them in the For Men section of any Christian bookstore.</p><p begin="00:33:28.87">The first thing they always tell you is that sex is a beautiful gift from God, even though it's a gift they don't want you to touch or even think about, because you're just going to ruin it with your filthy paws. Any physical pleasure, even pleasure you give yourself while alone, is completely forbidden. Then they tell you how to survive until marriage. They all run some variation on you can't help the first glance, but you can prevent the second.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh Harris</h4><p begin="00:33:53.31">You can obey God with your eyes. They don't have to see everything around them. If an attractive girl walks by they don't have to survey her body, but they must obey Jesus Christ.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:34:05.39">This is Josh Harris in the audio version of his book <i>Not</i> <i>Even</i> <i>a</i> <i>Hint:</i> <i>Guarding</i> <i>Your</i> <i>Heart</i> <i>Against</i> <i>Lust.</i> It's full of practical tips.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh Harris</h4><p begin="00:34:13.73">I don't know about your house, but at our home all kinds of sensuous and provocative clothing catalogs arrive in the mail uninvited. I've come to realize that I have to view even getting my mail as a battleground. Will I throw them away immediately or steal glances and flip through them for a quick thrill? If you're a guy with a similar struggle, ask your wife or mother to help you in this area by ridding your home of these unnecessary temptations.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:34:39.87">Other tips: these books tell you to watch TV with the remote in your hand, so if a sexy beer commercial comes on, or when the sports camera cuts to the cheerleaders, you can immediately jump to another channel. And be honest with yourself: when you watch ESPN2, aren't you hoping to see gymnastics? And guys need daily quiet time to read the Bible and pray for strength in the fight against temptation.</p><p begin="00:35:07.49">I don't know why, but in my case none of this ever worked. I wanted it to work, longed for it desperately, but every week or so late at night, I'd give in. "M happened again," I would write in my journal, as if it weren't an action but an event, something that could just engulf you like a flash flood or a car accident, something so terrible it could only be referred to in code.</p><p begin="00:35:43.65">I was an adulterer. That's what the Bible told me, and I struggled with the guilt of that every day. After high school I went to a huge state college in Tucson, and on warm days I would walk across campus feeling like a monster because I believed that noticing a girl's body was the spiritual equivalent of something like sexual assault.</p><p begin="00:36:06.02">I assumed all this was the same for all of us fundamentalist kids. At every all-guys prayer meeting I ever went to, someone was always asking for help with their thought life. But I'd never actually asked if anyone had quite the same problems I did. So I called my friend Derek, a missionary's kid who was my best friend from church back then.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek</h4><p begin="00:36:24.40">You're right, it wasn't your own obsession at all. I developed a technique of seeing girls as just floating heads. You just learn you're just not going to look below the neck, because it's like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:36:38.19">There's only bad news there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek</h4><p begin="00:36:40.39">Yeah, it did have this funny effect on-- I mean, I was a cartoonist for my college newspaper, and I didn't actually know how to draw girls really. You can see when I would draw a female figure top to bottom in a cartoon, there was an awkwardness to it, because I didn't actually know what they looked like. Those kinds of things are kind of-- it's funny to look back and talk about them now, but it was all very dead serious back then.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:37:08.84">Oh yeah, that's the other thing. It seems so trivial and silly, and yet it caused actual agony. We felt depraved.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek</h4><p begin="00:37:17.62">Yeah, and there's this terrible-- a real anger, a sense of unfairness at the media. Like Coors Lite put up these billboards with women in swimsuits on them, and they were very well-designed swimsuits. There they would be, right up in the sky. So you just felt like the devil was just absolutely this very wily opponent, and it's just in your face all the time. It's so frustrating if you're trying not to go out of your way to look for it, but then it seems like everybody's pushing it in your face.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:37:49.87">Do you ever wish you could go back?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derek</h4><p begin="00:37:53.39">Yeah. It's funny you should ask that, because I have actually had that imaginary conversation before. You see some time travel movie. You fantasize like, wow, if I had a chance to go back, what would I tell that kid? I think I would tell myself, you know what? You spend so much time straining over this one issue that you are avoiding or overlooking the whole rest of your spiritual journey.</p><p begin="00:38:31.44">I wasted a lot of time. There was  a lot of time wasted obsessing. I think that's kind of what you found out yourself too, right? It just gets to the point where things crack instead of bending.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Dave Dickerson</h4><p begin="00:38:43.44">He's right, they do crack. And for me they cracked worse than for Derek. I couldn't buy porn. That was obviously forbidden. I didn't have a girlfriend. I couldn't even watch MTV. So the only sexual experiences I had had were the ones that happened by accident: a woman bending over in a low-cut shirt, for instance.</p><p begin="00:39:04.05">And then at 22, I started finding myself walking slowly on campus, or in supermarkets or the library, hoping to see another accidental glimpse of something. It took more and more of my time. My grades started to suffer. I was like a stalker, but a shy one with incredibly low standards.</p><p begin="00:39:25.74">Then after a couple unbearable months of this, I begged my pastor for help. He suggested Sex Addicts Anonymous. At my first meeting we all told our stories. There was a guy who'd spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes in a single long weekend. There was a woman who had slept with a different guy almost every night for years. There was a huge tattooed biker who was so ashamed to be there that a friend led him in blindfolded. And then there was me, a 22-year-old virgin. When I told my story, there was an awkward silence. Even here, nobody understood my problem.</p><p begin="00:40:09.12">A few days later I went to a Christian counselor, expecting he'd just tell me to pray harder, look for answers in the Scripture. I explained my problem, and he looked at me and frowned, and he asked if I ever did the act, the one that I found so horrible I only referred to it in code. "Trust me," he said, "let yourself do it. Give yourself permission and see what happens."</p><p begin="00:40:32.88">This was shocking. That a Christian would give me this kind of advice, that it's possible to obey too much, that you could lead yourself astray by following the Bible's rules. That very day I took home my first <i>Playboy</i> magazine, and that was that. After five minutes I was no longer desperate to glimpse random women bending over the freezer cases at the grocery store. It felt like a miracle. It was so fast, so life-changing, that it was like converting all over again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:10.65">Dave Dickerson.

What can I do for you?</p><p begin="00:41:25.49">I work as a waiter. I've been here since 1994. That's almost 13 years working in this place.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:31.81">Hassan works the afternoon shift at a neighborhood restaurant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:41:34.55">Well people, usually they steal a lot of things. They steal different stuff. Some of them, they steal umbrellas from another customer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:44.26">Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:41:44.71">Oh yeah. I saw it with my eye. The guy was lawyer. He stole-- he had a broken umbrella. In the umbrella box there was a good umbrella. He took it away with him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:41:59.32">Do you think it might have a been mistake?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:42:00.92">I don't think so. Lawyers, they don't make mistake.</p><p begin="00:42:10.11">There was two couples. One of the couples, the wife, she used to sit on the right side corner.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:17.29">She'd sit in this booth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:42:18.43">Yeah, this booth. She used to take salt and pepper from table. No matter what we did, no matter what we said, no matter what we act, she never changed. She always took it. I believe that she took at least two dozens during the two years period.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:33.40">Two dozen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:42:34.35">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:35.23">They stole two dozen salt and pepper shakers?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:42:36.73">Yeah, total during the two years period. At one second I miss-- one second I miss-- gone.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:44.39">And she was a regular customer?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:42:45.97">Oh yeah, regular customer. I believe she was doing everywhere, wherever she goes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:42:53.34">What I don't understand is what will she do with two dozen salt and pepper shakers?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:42:57.06"> I don't know. I don't know. That's what I wanted to know too. Maybe she has a store.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:09.93">He says it doesn't happen often, the stealing, but there is a pattern he's noticed. One woman walked over to a display and took some food, and then sat down and ate the food. When he tried to charge her, she argued with him. When a man tried to take a huge stack of napkins, like this huge stack, and Hassan caught him, he didn't even seem embarrassed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hassan</h4><p begin="00:43:29.02">He got mad. He got mad at me because I said, "You are not allowed to take it."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:35.17">The people who steal, are they good tippers or bad?

  <h3>Commandment Nine. You Shall Not Bear False Witness.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:58.27">Which brings us to the Ninth Commandment. This hour is going so fast. Ninth Commandment: "Do not bear false witness." Don't lie.</p><p begin="00:44:05.79">To understand this next story you have to understand this idea of a mitzvah. For religious Jews, a mitzvah is a good deed. They're supposed to fill their days doing these good deeds. But "mitzvah" is also the Hebrew word for commandment, and when religious Jews count the commandments in the Bible, they don't just have the big 10, they count specifically 613 commandments they're supposed to follow.</p><p begin="00:44:23.78">Well the woman in this next story wanted to do one of the biggest of mitzvot ever. She was going to save somebody's life, a stranger's life. But to do this, she was going to have to break another one of the Commandments, the one about lying. In this case she was going to be lying to her own mother. Sarah Koenig tells more.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:44:38.94">Chaya Lipschutz does all her mother's shopping. She prepares all her meals for her, does all her cooking. And they're extremely close-- best friends, Chaya says, and she means it. And they also live in this tiny space together, a two-room basement apartment in Borough Park in Brooklyn, where they share a tiny bedroom and sleep in two tiny beds, really cots, that are about a foot apart from each other.</p><p begin="00:45:01.73">In this kind of set up it's unimaginable that you could keep anything from your mother. But Chaya had this whopper of a secret. She wanted to donate a kidney to someone, to a stranger, after seeing an ad in a Jewish newspaper taken out by somebody who needed one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:45:16.08">The ad was like screaming out to me. It said, "Save a life, be m'chaim," which means to fulfill a once-in-a-lifetime mitzvah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:45:24.47">It would be an uber-mitzvah, and she was going to do it unless her mother found out first. Her mother has a kind of phobia about surgery, and also like any parent, she would worry about all the things that could go wrong. So Chaya didn't tell her mother about her plan, which took many, many months to put together. She got away with it until her mother found some ads about kidney donation that Chaya accidentally left on the kitchen table. She lectured Chaya about it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:45:50.29">"It's not for you." Like I think she said to me that I could do any other mitzvah except this one. She just like-- I didn't answer her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:00.14">But how old were you at this point?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:46:02.78">This was only-- I mean, right. I'm an adult. I'm a grown-up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:07.79">She can't forbid you to do anything really.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:46:09.89">But you know what? I didn't want to cause her any pain or any suffering. Don't forget, she's an older lady, and people sometimes can have heart attacks and die. I wanted to give a life. I dind't want to take away a life at the same time. But even if she didn't have a heart attack, it would give her so much suffering and I didn't want to-- I never, ever like to upset her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:40.57">Chaya tried to follow the commandment about not lying. For her, lying's a sin, never mind lying to your own mother. She could argue that not saying anything about the kidney transplant wasn't strictly lying, but as the surgery date got closer, Chaya couldn't cling to that technicality. She was getting a lot of phone calls. She had to go for medical tests all the time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:58.84">When you would go out and get tests and do these things, where would you tell her you were going?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:47:09.38">I had to say other things. You're dragging it out of me. OK, OK. You know what? I did have to give little white lies.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:47:19.64">And what were the white lies? Like what kinds of things would you say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:47:26.50">I don't even want to go into details. I'm like embarrassed. It wasn't bad. I don't tell her anything all that bad.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:47:34.97">Chaya feels so guilty that she lied to her mother, she can barely talk about it, and the lies just became more overt as the day of the surgery arrived.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:47:42.22">I had to spend the night before near the hospital.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:47:47.45">What did you tell her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:47:48.88">Oh gosh. I told her I was going to go to a friend's house. It was a house, and my friend was there. My kidney-- my person I was donating the kidney to, she was like a friend already.</p><p begin="00:48:11.45">Oh gosh. I had this huge bag to bring with me to the hospital. Because like I didn't want her to see how much I was taking, when my mother went to the bathroom that night before I left the house, I took my stuff actually out to the side of the house and left it there, and then I went back in the house. So this way I just went-- I didn't leave with that much, maybe a shopping bag, to go. Oh gosh.</p><p begin="00:48:47.01">But you know what? That was hard for me because I don't like to lie. But that, it was all to do a good thing. It wasn't anything selfish. You know what I mean? It was all-- you know, sometimes you're-- listen, I don't want people to think you're allowed to do white lies, but sometimes you have to. Sometimes you have to. You have no choice in it. I'm doing this to save another person's life. I'm sure you know as a result of what I did, God's going to forgive me for all those white lies.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:49:28.43">It's one thing to plan to donate your kidney and not tell your mother. It's another thing to actually have your organ removed and not tell your mother. So Chaya had to figure out some way to break it to her once it was a done deal. And her scheme for doing this is so complicated, it makes all the earlier lies look really junior varsity. What happened is that by chance, the same week of her surgery, somebody told Chaya about this 23-year-old Hasidic woman who had also donated a kidney to a stranger.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:49:54.30">And I met this very lovely young woman, Feigi. I said to her, would you be willing to tell my mother-- to come over to my mother's house after the surgery and tell her that she donated a kidney, and then tell her, by the way I donated a kidney, and I'm in the hospital right now. Let her be the one to tell her, because my mother will see that she's healthy, she looks healthy, and she's young, and she doesn't look like she had major surgery a few months earlier. And so I told her, call my mother and tell her this way, that you have tzedakah, charity, to give to one of my mother's charities. And that was a good way to get into the house.</p><p begin="00:50:36.70">And I arranged it that my kidney recipient's family is going to call her after Feigi-- after the surgery. So she called my mother, and my mother was like almost out the door. And she says, no, please, please wait, I have tzedakah to give, charity to give to one of your charities. Of course, my mother waited. And so she sat down with her, and she said she donated a kidney. And my mother looked at her, panned down, and sees she's normal, and healthy, and she just did something like three months earlier. And she came with a cute little baby. And then she said to her, by the way, your daughter's right now in the hospital, and she did the same thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:51:16.35">To everyone's relief, Chaya's mother did not have a heart attack.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:51:19.56">My mother smiled, and she says, it's mena shamayim, it's from heaven. It's heavenly thing that was meant to be. And she took it very, very well, just like I thought. It was just exactly according to my script, the way everything worked out. She was happy. She was happy, and I was like, [RELIEVED SIGH]. I was like so happy it was like all over, that she took it well, and she was proud of me. It was like such a relief.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:51:47.91">It sounds like dealing with your mother was so much harder than actually doing anything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Chaya Lipschutz</h4><p begin="00:51:51.44">Exactly. Donating a kidney was easy for me. The hardest part was not telling my mother.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:52:06.68">Chaya's mother never said anything to her about the white lies, and Chaya's still not sure she even knows about them. And she never chastised Chaya for keeping the surgery from her. She's just proud of Chaya, which is what Chaya wanted all along. Last month Chaya's brother, inspired by her, donated his kidney to a stranger. He said his mother had no problem with it at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:30.76">Sarah Koenig is one of the producers of our show.</p></div>  </div>

I want a Sidekick, but  haven't got it yet. See, yeah, she has one. She has one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:47.03">You have a Sidekick? Can we see?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:53:49.76">This girl, Christine, pulls out her Sidekick and shows it around. The photo on the Sidekick's little display is herself, which definitely is one of the things that is normal when a kid does it but would be so weird if an adult tried it. She hasn't had the Sidekick for very long.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christine</h4><p begin="00:54:05.40">I don't really remember. I think it was in the beginning of April.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:07.80">Oh, so just a couple weeks ago?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christine</h4><p begin="00:54:08.92">Yeah. It's cool actually, because I get to go on the internet, and I get to go on AOL, text message, all of that. It's really good. It's like a extra computer, a little computer for myself to carry around. A portable everything. A portable everything, basically.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:24.13">And did you want one for a long time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christine</h4><p begin="00:54:26.10">Yeah, I actually did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:27.70">Now were there people who didn't talk to you before the Sidekick, who when you got the Sidekick--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christine</h4><p begin="00:54:31.81">Yeah, there was a lot of people that didn't talk to me. And now that I have my Sidekick, they like every day want to use it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:38.25">So they just want to use the Sidekick? They don't want to actually--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christine</h4><p begin="00:54:41.12">Yeah, they just want the Sidekick. They don't want me, they want the Sidekick.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:47.94">These girls actually had very grown-up attitude about all the stuff they covet. This stuff matters to them, but it doesn't totally matter. Kayla wasn't wearing Nikes or Cons, and nobody cared. Sweena and Amy recently got iPods, and they're the first to admit it didn't change how anybody saw them. They joke about how they waste a lot of time thinking and talking about this stuff, and I reminded them that it's in the Bible that we're not supposed to want stuff, or be jealous of people who have stuff we don't have.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:10.73">Do you think it's realistic that people aren't going to want stuff?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Christine</h4><p begin="00:55:14.01">No, because everybody wants stuff at some point.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:55:16.47">I think it's just natural. Everybody is going to want something in life. You're not going to go through life not wanting anything. You're not going to just go through life, OK, I have this and I have that. I don't need anything else, or I don't want this. I think it's just natural for people to want things.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:30.71">But then you're saying in a way it's natural, that we're always going to be breaking one of The Ten Commandments.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:55:35.10">Basically, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:41.36">If we needed any proof of this, that we're always going to want stuff, and sometimes we're going to want stuff that we probably shouldn't, it was just a few feet away. A girl named Nadie had written on her arm, down the length of her arm, Nadie n' David. That's the letter N, with a heart underneath it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nadie</h4><p begin="00:55:57.28">That's my boyfriend.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:59.55">And is he in your grade?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nadie</h4><p begin="00:56:01.08">No, he's older than me. He's two years older than me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:56:03.60">Talk about him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:05.01">That's her girlfriend, egging her on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nadie</h4><p begin="00:56:07.05">He's nice. I broke up with him once, but we're going back out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:56:11.13">He broke her heart, but I don't think she should be going out with him, because she's messed up. I'm mad at her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nadie</h4><p begin="00:56:16.61">People were saying that he talked [BLEEP] about me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:56:18.82">Yeah, it's true. It's true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nadie</h4><p begin="00:56:21.17">But I love him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:56:23.39">You don't know what love is, Nadie. That's until you get to 16. Look, that's David over there. That's David over there. Look. He's with another girl.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nadie</h4><p begin="00:56:35.86">With the one in black sweater.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:37.52">He's walking arm in arm with another girl.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Girl</h4><p begin="00:56:43.86">That's it, right there. See, that's what make us mad, right there. [INTERPOSING VOICES] That's messed up. Yo, that's messed up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:59.66">Catechism of the Catholic church says the Tenth Commandment concerns the intentions of the heart. The catechism talks about desires that are often good, wholesome desires that come to exceed the limits of reason, and make us want things too much, especially things that really belong to somebody else. Wanting things too much, it says, is a form of sadness. The Tenth Commandment? That's what it's trying to eradicate.</p><p begin="00:57:36.92">Our program was produced today by Jane Feltes and myself, with Alex Blumberg, Sarah Koenig, Lisa Pollak, Alissa Shipp, and Nancy Updike. Our senior producer is Julie Snyder, our production help from Seth Lind, Tommy Andres, and Emily Youssef. Music help from Jessica Hopper. Mary Robertson produced our story about the Ninth Commandment. Thanks today to Liebman's Deli in the Bronx, where we taped the story for the Eighth Commandment about stealing. Thanks to Middle School 51 in Brooklyn, where we taped our Tenth Commandment story, and especially to one of the seventh grade teachers there, Andrew Ravin.</p><p begin="00:58:03.13"><i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i> is distributed by Public Radio International.
