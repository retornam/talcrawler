Now, we're about a block from your house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lauren Waterman</h4><p begin="00:00:34.35">Like on that-- In front of that building, right there, this like churchy looking building, was where we were parked when we first had the conversation where we decided we were going to be exclusive, which was a joke. Like I don't really date around. And I don't think he does either. But, you know, it's like kind of a big conversation. But yeah, we were parked in the middle of that block, right where that white car is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:57.19">And so every time you walk down this street, you'll think like, oh yeah, there's the spot?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lauren Waterman</h4><p begin="00:01:01.54">I don't walk down this street. I just don't. Like I haven't even seen him for a month. You know what I mean?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:09.84">When I walked around Lauren's neighborhood with her, it had been two months since her boyfriend broke up with her. They'd gone out for about 10 months before that. She was incredibly nice to let herself be taped in still a pretty raw state. But even in the middle of that raw state, she was acutely aware, and said herself, that everything she was going through was a cliche, a cliche that she was forced to live through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lauren Waterman</h4><p begin="00:01:30.72">That's the crazy thing about it. Breaking up with someone is literally the most common thing. Like everyone you know broke up with everyone they ever dated, until maybe the person they're with right now, if they're with someone right now. But when it happens to you, it feels so specific. I don't want to say I can't get over it in like a flippant way. Like, you kind of can't get over it. You're like, what? This is what's happening? It's so shocking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:59.48">If I had to say one thing about Lauren, it's that she was full of feelings that completely contradicted each other, which, I guess, just comes with this territory. Like she emphatically did not want him to call. But also, maybe a little bit, wanted him to call. She missed him. And she didn't want to stop thinking about him. But she also did all this elaborate math to calculate the day that she would finally be over him and not thinking about him and with somebody else.</p><p begin="00:02:25.26">We get to an area where she had been on walks with the ex-boyfriend. There are benches and a sidewalk promenade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lauren Waterman</h4><p begin="00:02:31.99">I don't know. We used to just-- It's not that we took a ton of walks, but we took some walks.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:39.18">And what happened down here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lauren Waterman</h4><p begin="00:02:45.52">You know, I can't say that anything of substance happened. It's not like any one specific thing. It's just-- I don't know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:57.40">It's just that there was an us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lauren Waterman</h4><p begin="00:03:00.14">I know. There really was. That's the thing that's so weird. It's like you just-- You put so much energy into something. And then, one day it's time to stop. I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:22.07">During a break-up, you just stare at what happened. There's a before. And there's an after. And you just can't believe it. Lauren says she still doesn't even understand what went wrong between her and him. And that's part of it too so much of the time.</p><p begin="00:03:36.44">Well, we got the idea for today's radio show from an email that a listener sent. It says-- I have it here. "Dear <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>, I'm suffering from a gut-wrenching break-up with my former boyfriend. And I searched your site for shows about break-ups and general heartbreak to commiserate. But to my surprise, I didn't find many stories specifically regarding the act of breaking up. Hope you consider it. A show like that would really cheer me up.</p><p begin="00:04:01.41">And so with that in mind, we devote our show today to break-ups. Partly today, we have an anatomy of the completely contradictory feelings that are part of a break-up. I think that's what makes it such a special and particularly cursed state. And we have stories today about people trying in some very unusual, very resourceful ways to make themselves feel better during a break-up. The keyword there would be trying.</p><p begin="00:04:31.15">Our show today in four acts. In Act One, Starlee Kine heads out on a break-up mission unlike any we have ever heard of. In Act Two, an eight-year-old heads out into the world to get some answers about her parent's break-up. In Act Three, a man who has turned his back on the ways of this people, his people, in this case, being divorce lawyers. Act Four, Merrill Markoe notes one possibly overlooked way to mend a broken heart. And it involves a soggy, plastic, disky thing. You'll just have to trust me on that one. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One. Dr. Phil.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:16.60">Act One: Dr. Phil. When one of our regular contributors, Starlee Kine, was in the middle of getting over a break-up, she tried to feel better in a way that few people ever try, and that maybe even she shouldn't have. Here's Starlee.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:05:32.12">Before I explain why I decided to write and record a break-up song, even though I have no musical ability and can't play an instrument of any kind, I should probably explain a bit about the break-up itself. It was only after Anthony broke up with me that all the warning signs I had missed came sharply into focus, like the time he told me he didn't like taking pictures of girlfriends because it was a downer to have those photos around once a relationship was over.</p><p begin="00:05:56.06">I'd had a crush on him since the day we met. But he always had a girlfriend in Canada. Then, she broke up with him. And we got together. A week after that, he told me I was the one. Which, in retrospect, was probably the biggest warning sign of all.</p><p begin="00:06:11.24">It was hands-down the corniest relationship I've ever been in, and by corniest, I mean greatest. We'd pass entire evenings just complimenting each other. We took hand-holding to new heights. And we listened to hours and hours of music, teenager style, playing one song after another while smiling a lot.</p><p begin="00:06:32.23">I don't quite remember how our Phil Collins phase began. I think it was one of those things that started off ironically, with Anthony lip syncing adorably to "Against All Odds" one night. But over time, it became less and less ironic, until one day, we were actual fans.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:06:48.64">[SINGING] How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace, when I stand here taking every breath with you? Ooh, ooh. You're the only one who really knew me at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:07:10.76">We liked how honest and sad it was. "How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace? You're the only one who really knew me at all." We pictured Phil Collins at the piano writing it, the tears running down his face.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:07:27.72">[SINGING] I wish I could just make you turn around, turn around and see me cry. There's so much I need to say to you, so many reasons why.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:07:43.87">Anthony broke up me on New Year's Eve. I told you, corny. I didn't really see it coming. And I definitely didn't want it to happen. He said, you're going to be OK. I just cried and cried. I wanted to stop it, to fix it.</p><p begin="00:07:58.78">I searched deep inside myself for the right words to say, and out of my mouth popped this, how can you just let me walk away? I'm the only one who really knew you at all. And I meant it. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that in that moment, no one could have conveyed how I was feeling better than Phil Collins.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:08:17.78">[SINGING] Take a good look at me now, 'cause I'll still be standing here. And you coming back to me is against all odds. It's the chance I've got to take.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:08:37.00">If I thought I'd been in a Phil Collins phase before, it was nothing compared to what came next. I was no longer listening to his songs for pleasure, but for pain. They were break-up songs. And hearing them was the only thing that made me feel better. And by better, I mean worse.</p><p begin="00:08:52.13">There's something so satisfying about listening to sad songs. They're like how you would actually be spending your day if you were allowed to just break down and sob and grab hold of everyone you met. They make you feel less alone with your crazy thoughts. They don't judge you. In fact, they understand you.</p><p begin="00:09:08.30">A break-up song won't ever suggest you start online dating or that you're better off without him. They tell you that you're worse without him, which is exactly what you want to hear because it's how you feel. I didn't want to be cheered up. I didn't want to bounce back. I didn't want to meet someone new. I wanted to wallow, big time, deeply, and with the least amount of perspective possible. And the only way to do that was by turning off my phone and turning up the sad, sad music. Like this song that I love by the band The Magnetic Fields.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>The Magnetic Fields</h4><p begin="00:09:41.62">[SINGING] I don't want to get over you. I guess I could take a sleeping pill and sleep at will and not have to go through what I go through. I guess I should take Prozac, right? And just smile all night at somebody new, somebody not too bright, but sweet and kind, who'd try to get you off my mind. I could leave this agony behind, which is just what I'd do if I wanted to. But I don't want to get over you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:10:21.64">It's great because the lyrics perfectly articulate this feeling you didn't even know you had. Then there's the Bonnie Raitt song, "I Can't Make You Love Me."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bonnie Raitt</h4><p begin="00:10:30.11">[SINGING] I'll close my eyes. Then I won't see the love you don't feel when you're holding me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:10:44.95">The song was written by Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin after they read this little article in the newspaper about a guy who'd gotten drunk and shot up his girlfriend's car. At his sentencing, he was asked if he learned any lessons from what he'd done. And he said, "Yes, you can't make a woman love you if she don't."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bonnie Raitt</h4><p begin="00:11:01.66">[SINGING] 'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't. You can't make your heart feel something it won't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:11:17.76">Before the break-up, I had no idea how much break-up music was out there, for example, every song ever written, or at least every third. But once you're heartbroken, you notice it everywhere. You find yourself in the supermarket listening to a song you've heard before, but never really heard, thinking to yourself it's just so true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Foreigner</h4><p begin="00:11:38.23">[SINGING] In my life, there's been heartache and pain. I don't know if I can face it again. Can't stop now. I've travelled so far to change this lonely life. I wanna know what love is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:12:07.11">It's not just that you overlook the cheesiness, you embrace it. You do want to know what love is. There's nothing restrained or subtle about being crushed by the person you care most about in the world. It's big and gaudy. And so it only makes sense that songs about it are too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Foreigner</h4><p begin="00:12:21.87">[SINGING] I know you can show me. Ohhhhhhh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:12:32.14">It was after listening to all these songs for months that I knew what I had to do. I had to write one myself. I needed to take charge of my pain. I needed to take wallowing to the next level. It wasn't enough just to be lying on the floor in my pajamas, listening to these songs at 3:00 in the afternoon. I wanted to be the songs. I wanted to be the pain. I wanted to be inside the stereo speakers, to be the sound waves coming into my own head. I wanted to be the thing creating the feeling I was feeling.</p><p begin="00:13:00.58">And I knew just what kind of break-up song I would write. [MUSIC-"YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU LOVE ME" BY DUSTY SPRINGFIELD} A torch song. Torch songs are about the most pathetic, desperate, and lonely part of yourself, the part you'd never admit to your friends, the part of you that knows without a shadow of a doubt that you would take him back. Not only that, he wouldn't have to beg or even apologize. Dusty Springfield made a whole career out of these songs: "I Just Can't Make It Alone," "I Only Want To Be With You," "All I See Is You," "Losing You," or this one, which might be the most pitiful sentiment ever uttered out loud.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dusty Springfield</h4><p begin="00:13:40.32">[SINGING] You don't have to say you love me. Just be close at hand. You don't have to stay forever. I will understand. Believe me. Believe me. I can't help but love you. But believe me, I'll never tie you down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:14:06.55">It's just so pathetic. And deep down, it's how I felt too. And it felt good to have someone just come out and say it. There are some words you can never speak, but somehow you can sing.</p><p begin="00:14:19.04">So I knew what kind of song I was going to write. But I had no idea how to go about writing it. I needed some advice. And out of thousands of musicians who write about heartbreak, there was only one I cared to talk to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:14:30.10">Hi.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:14:30.48">Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:14:31.21">Hi, Starlee. Can you hear me OK?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:14:34.96">Yeah. I can hear you great.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:14:36.69">Phil Collins, of course. What? Is that weird? I got it into my head that it'd be great to ask Phil Collins how to write a break-up song, the same way you might think to yourself, I'd really love to talk to Michael Jordan about free throws. I never thought it would actually happen.</p><p begin="00:14:52.06">Then, against all odds, it turned out I had a friend who was on the road with Phil Collins on his Genesis reunion tour, shooting footage for the DVD extras. He gave me his contact info. And I sent him an email: Dear Mr. Collins, I have a rather unusual request. Then, I waited, refreshing my inbox every three seconds.</p><p begin="00:15:12.58">When his email finally appeared, he was friendly and casual. We set up a time to talk. In my mind, he was already so intimately involved in my break-up that it seemed crazy that he didn't actually know about it. So I told him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:15:25.44">Well, I'm going to tell you the whole story of my break-up and stuff, OK? Is that OK?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:15:30.34">Yeah. Yeah. It's your 45 minutes. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:15:32.46">OK. Well, it also involves you. So I was dating my boyfriend, Anthony. And he kind of broke up with me on New Year's Eve.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:15:44.62">Yeah. Nice. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:15:46.29">Whereas before it was Anthony and I talking about Phil, now it was Phil and I talking about Anthony. Actually pretty tidy, when you think about it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:15:53.56">And at one point, I turned to him. And it just flew out of my mouth. I just looked at him. And I was like, I can't believe you're just going to let me--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:16:03.88">--walk away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:16:04.42">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:16:05.69">And before long, Phil Collins and I were commiserating about heartbreak, which he also went through recently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:16:10.86">So I mean, I've just been through a marriage break-up. And you talk about New Year's Eve. I mean, my divorce was final on my birthday.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:16:17.93">Oh, really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:16:19.32">And I didn't want it at all. So that's something that-- You always remember these things. Like you'll always remember New Year's Eve. And I'll always remember my birthday.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:16:29.15">I know. And it makes you want to skip those dates, doesn't it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:16:31.97">Yeah. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:16:33.95">Up until this conversation, I never thought I had much in common with Phil Collins. He started playing in Genesis at the age of 19. I didn't. He performed in Live Aid, while I only watched it on TV. He was in the movie <i>Buster</i>, which I never actually saw.</p><p begin="00:16:49.22">But talking to him was easy. He told me that when he was in Genesis, he just played drums and sang. He didn't write. "Against All Odds" was one of the first songs he wrote himself, when he was working on his first solo album.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:17:00.51">That song, particularly, was written during my first divorce. My first wife and the kids had gone. And I was just left there. So it was written totally out of experience, as opposed to this is a [? what- ?] if song. You know what I mean?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:17:16.51">Yeah. Yeah. Do you think you could have written that song if you hadn't gone through-- if your wife hadn't left?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:17:24.65">Probably not. I mean, frankly, if that personal stuff had not happened to me at that time, I probably would never have made an album. And if I was to have made an album, eventually, it would have been more of a jazz/rock thing, because that was what I was actually-- that was my output. Apart from Genesis, I was in a band called Brand X. I was a player. So, no. Without that stuff, I wouldn't have felt the things I felt that made me sit at a piano night after night, day after day writing stuff.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:18:07.13">Did it help?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:18:09.93">Well, it helped in as much as-- It was kind of, well, when she hears this, it's all going to be OK. You know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:18:15.04">Really? Is that what you thought?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:18:16.65">I did. Yeah. Foolish, huh? I mean, I did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:18:26.45">Did you get over it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:18:34.53">There's various people in your life that you never quite get over. I mean, that's kind of the cliche. And then, sometimes, with me for example, because of children, you are morally obligated. And you need, because of you want to be with the kids as much as possible, you have to be in touch with this person that has really hurt you. So it's not like you can just walk away and leave without a trace, because in this instance, there's a couple of little guys that are looking up to you saying, what am I going to do, Dad?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:19:13.63">OK. There are so many crazy things about this. First of all, even Phil Collins can't help but quote Phil Collins. Second, if it hadn't been for his wife leaving him in 1979, Phil Collins would never have become Phil Collins. Heartbreak turned a jazz/rock fusion drummer into an international pop icon.</p><p begin="00:19:32.71">But the other crazy thing was how honest and normal he was about it. Once again, Phil Collins put into words what I was feeling. There's a part of me, and it is not a small part, that wants my ex, Anthony, to hear the song I write and ask to come back.</p><p begin="00:19:48.70">I told Phil that I had been trying to write my songs. But they just didn't feel right. They were too wordy or something. But when I tried to consult songs that I love to see how it was done, even the lyrics to the best songs looked flat on the page. I wanted to know how to transform cliched sentiment into a song that captured the entire range of human emotions. I wanted to know how simple sentences like, "love hurts, love scars, became--</p></div><div class="subjects"><h4>Gram Parsons And Emmylou Harris</h4><p begin="00:20:14.19">[SINGING] Love hurts. Love scars. Love wounds and mars.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:20:27.50">Most of the time, it's the direct-- I mean, if it's a good song, that's what makes it good is the fact that it's-- So many people try to fluff things up or disguise them or make them a little bit too clever. But sometimes, it's the simplest thing that actually reaches people.</p></div><div class="subjects"><h4>Gram Parsons And Emmylou Harris</h4><p begin="00:20:54.36">[SINGING] Love hurts. Mm, mm, love hurts.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:21:03.79">It actually looks corny when you look at it on the page.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:21:07.07">But then, you see, what becomes important then is the way that it's sung.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:21:12.44"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Phil Collins</h4><p begin="00:21:13.70">Because you get-- Otherwise you get-- And I don't mean any disrespect-- but you get into sort of Michael Bolton territory. I've got nothing against Michael. I'm just using him as an example. I'm sure people would use me as an example of something that gets overblown and polished, as opposed to a simple idea, simply sung, and obviously, sounds like it's sung with conviction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:21:37.02">So now I had the advice. I had the pain. It was time to start writing. It was pretty terrifying at first. Every single word I put down seemed wrong, even the ones that seemed like they had to go in, the no-brainers. I'd type the word love, then erase it, and then type it again.</p><p begin="00:21:54.06">Then, one day, I was waiting for the train. And I started thinking about how that train reminded me of Anthony, and then how our love was sort of like a runaway train. Oh, that's good, I thought, and scribbled the line down on the back of my gas bill. Suddenly, heartbreak was flowing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. And it was up to me to transform it into song.</p><p begin="00:22:14.33">The next problem was-- and it felt like a small problem really-- was my complete lack of musical ability. So I asked a guy named Joe McGinty for some help. He's a New York musician who has played with everyone from The Ramones, to Ryan Adams, to Ronnie Spector. He was in The Psychedelic Furs. He has a million songs. More importantly, for my purposes at least, Joe is a man who understands heartbreak. Here's one of his songs I really like.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Mcginty</h4><p begin="00:22:40.55">[SINGING] This song is three weeks old. Guess I should sing it. Happy Birthday. And your image, it still holds. A happy accident, I can't seem to shake you from my mind.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:23:10.19">Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Mcginty</h4><p begin="00:23:12.69">Is anybody else--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:23:14.76">I'm good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:23:15.18">So I met up with Joe and also Julia Greenberg, a musician and songwriter who plays with Joe a lot. I had written about a dozen songs, some of them more finished than others. When I printed them out, I had six freshly typed pages of lyrics, and then about 15 crazy looking pages with a few lines here and there, separated by random spaces. I had sent these all off to Joe and Julia before our meeting. Here's Joe reading the one I thought was farthest along.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Mcginty</h4><p begin="00:23:39.54">OK. "Imaginary Boyfriend." "I can't help but think this all could have been prevented if I'd just gone to a small liberal arts school, because then I would have met my imaginary boyfriend at a stand-up comedy open mic. It was love at first eye roll. He said he drew comic books, like David on <i>Roseanne.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:23:57.65">Wow. I thought I'd been working on a song. But I don't even know how to describe what that was: a creative writing class essay, maybe. It was clear that I'd ignored Phil Collins' advice: keep it simple, not clever. Joe and Julia agreed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:24:12.26">I think the like David on <i>Roseanne</i>, I can't turn into a song.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:24:15.91">Then, Julia pulled out her favorite of my songs from the very bottom of the stack. I'd been so sure it wasn't a contender that I'd almost not included it at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:24:23.74">You had the lyric, "It doesn't do me any good. In fact, it does me bad." Then, it kind of seems impossible to me that that hasn't been in a pop song before. But like, that's a classic kind of pop song--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Mcginty</h4><p begin="00:24:37.45">I mean, that's what you look for.

That's a classic pop song line.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:24:41.83">I have to admit I was skeptical. That lyric was from the crazy pile, just notes for an idea I had for a torch song. I had tried to think of the most pathetic scenario I could. What I came up with was this: Anthony goes back to his ex-girlfriend. But rather than letting him go, I agree to be this awkward third wheel, as long as it means still getting to see him occasionally. The lines were literally, "I liked you. And you liked her. And I sort of liked her, because you liked her." Julia had run with the idea, with one minor change.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:25:12.64">Do you know that you had it all "like." And I changed it to "love." That was the biggest--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:25:16.67">God, that makes-- I feel like there's something really, deeply-- There are like even more issues that I have to work out with myself, that I put "like" and not "love." It didn't even occur to me.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:25:27.12">Julia had been so sure it was an actual song that she'd gotten to work before our meeting. She'd sketched out a melody and sung it to Joe on his answering machine. They played it for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:25:36.91">Yeah. All right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Mcginty</h4><p begin="00:25:38.22">And it's still --</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:25:39.98">This is going to be a rough--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Joe Mcginty</h4><p begin="00:25:41.26">--very rough</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:25:41.46">--rendering of the opus.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Greenberg</h4><p begin="00:25:53.54">[SINGING] I loved you.

I mean Phil Collins.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Starlee Kine</h4><p begin="00:27:28.57">Can I play my song for you? Is that OK?

I'd like to say I've gone back and forth on whether I even want him to, but the truth is, of course I do. Everyone I talk to, from my best friend all the way to Phil Collins, says he'll listen. And yes, if the roles were reversed and it were me, I definitely would. But I know Anthony. If anyone could resist listening, it would be him. You're just going to have to trust me on this one.</p><p begin="00:31:50.03">Which doesn't mean I think he'll never hear the song. I can see him keeping a copy of it in some box stuffed with mix tapes and copies of SAT scores so that he can listen to it one day when he's ready. I picture him 40 years from now, an old man, living in some house that I'll never see, which breaks my heart. In my head, he doesn't look like a real old man, but like a young one wearing stage makeup. I imagine him sitting down to finally listen on the CD player that people make fun of him for still having. He loads it in and hits play. He listens to the entire song from start to finish. And when it's over, he plays it again and again, until the tears are running down his face.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:32:32.19">Starlee Kine.

I don't know how.</p><p begin="00:41:37.45">And then recently-- I think it was probably when I graduated college when I heard it again-- I heard it as an adult. And it was so heartbreaking. I didn't think it was sad when it was me. It was just what was going on. And it made me sad to hear pain in my voice, confusion.</p><p begin="00:41:59.75">And now I hear it even differently as an educator. I hear it as, what would I say to her?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Noah Adams</h4><p begin="00:42:06.86">And looking back at that moment, did you really want the truth? Or did you want things to be well again and whole again?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Betsy Walter</h4><p begin="00:42:14.07">I don't believe that I wanted what the truth really was. But I wanted what I had created the truth to be in my head. I wanted them to say something to the fact that, oh, we just needed time apart. And of course, we'll come back together. I wanted what I thought the truth was. If I had heard the real truth, I think that it would have been devastating.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Noah Adams</h4><p begin="00:42:36.50">Your dad was fooling around?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Betsy Walter</h4><p begin="00:42:37.69">Mm hmm. And my mom did an amazing job of never, ever putting any blame on him, of always being supportive of us having a relationship. But if she had said the truth, I couldn't have a relationship with him. I would have been too angry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Noah Adams</h4><p begin="00:42:55.13">OK. Let's imagine this, your advice just to that eight-year-old Betsy, who was you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Betsy Walter</h4><p begin="00:43:02.30">I do grapple with this. It's hard because I know exactly what I wanted to hear when I was eight. I think I would tell her that, you know what-- I would actually say, this is probably how your life is going to be. Your parents made this choice for you. And now, instead of questioning and wondering for so long why this choice was made, how are you going to live your life now, knowing this is your life? I still know myself. And I would have been persistent, wanting answers regardless. But I do think that I needed to feel less helpless.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:49.57">Betsy Allison Walter, talking with NPR's Noah Adams.

  <h3>Act Three. Let No Court Put Asunder.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:18.76">Act Three: Let No Court Put Asunder. Now, we have this example of somebody trying to make break-ups less horrible than they are. Barry Berkman used to be like any divorce lawyer. He fought for his clients. He tried to get them big settlements. But he came to believe that what he was doing actually was not so good for most of his clients, which is kind of a big problem. Here's the kind of thing he would see. A guy comes in, ready for a divorce.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:44:44.14">His wife had a lot of money. They had worked out a deal. But they did it on their own, without seeing lawyers.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:52.98">What did they decide?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:44:54.43">And what they decided was that in order for him-- he was a musician, didn't have that much money. But in order for him to live close to her and to be able to see the kids, which they both wanted, she was going to give him enough money to purchase a small co-op. And it was great. They were both happy as could be. They were ready to do it.</p><p begin="00:45:17.64">They were told to see lawyers. He came to see us. We were fine with it. We said, sure. This looks good. You did a good job. She went to see a lawyer. No way. How can you give him that much? It's not right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:30.81">That's what her lawyer was saying?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:45:31.83">Absolutely. For the lawyer, it was too much, because he had an argument which could, theoretically, end up giving her the greater part of her separate property. She ended up listening to the lawyer. We ended up with a custody fight as well as a divorce fight.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:50.87">Wait. And is that because the money fight got so bitter at one point?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:45:54.27">Exactly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:54.54">Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:45:54.80">Yeah. Then, they started fighting over the kids, which they hadn't fought over at all.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:45:57.98">Well, wait. How did that kick in? Like what was the moment where it went from being just about money to being about the kids too?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:46:04.65">What happened was, the parties got so angry at each other that they started quibbling about everything. So if he had a gig and couldn't be home on time one evening, she decided he was an unfit parent. If she was spending too much time with her new boyfriend, which this guy decided wasn't appropriate, she became an unfit parent.</p><p begin="00:46:29.23">So the parties ended up fighting not only about money, but about the kids. Used up a good bit of her vast inheritance in the case. And in the end, she ended up buying him the same, or similar, co-op in a similar neighborhood as the one she would have in the first place. But it took a couple of years, embittered everyone. And you had to think, was this worthwhile? Did it have to happen?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:46:54.88">Adversarial style divorces still make up half of all divorce proceedings in the country. And Barry felt like most of those cases ended up like this one: incredibly expensive, taking a huge emotional toll on everybody, damaging children. So after 15 years of doing these cases like this, he started looking for a different way. And he found something called collaborative divorce.</p><p begin="00:47:15.23">In collaborative divorce, each spouse gets a lawyer. And then, the spouses and the lawyers sit down in a room together to work out some kind of agreement. But under the rules of collaborative divorce, if one of the lawyers thinks that the other side is being intransigent or unreasonable, not only can he not threaten to go to court, if it does go to court, he has to give up the case. He has to give the case to another lawyer to do. So the lawyers have an incentive to work everything out.</p><p begin="00:47:40.62">So, OK. They all sit down together, the spouses and the lawyers. And Barry Berkman says that even though the spouses enter the situation with good intentions of working everything out, the biggest obstacle he has is something very simple.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:47:52.86">I think, often, what happens is, couples in conflict lose the ability to listen to each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:00.23">And so you find yourself, very often, saying to your own client, no, no, no, no, no, listen to what they're saying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:48:05.97">Absolutely. Absolutely.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:09.54">And so one of the things--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:48:10.25">Not to agree with it, but at least to understand it. That's the whole question. To recognize that your point of view doesn't necessarily invalidate your spouse's point of view.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:23.57">You're saying the most important thing people need to do is simply just listen to each other and try to get along.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:48:30.08">I would say listen to each other. I don't know about getting along.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:33.52">They don't have to try to get along.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:48:35.77">Certainly, listening goes a long way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:37.74">Do things get so reasonable that you get people listening to each other well enough that people eventually just get back together?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:48:45.95">I've had that happen once.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:48.50">What happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:48:49.81">What happened was, we had people who simply couldn't listen to each other. He became very, very busy in his own law practice. She felt she was losing him. Part of it was, they couldn't find the time to talk to each other.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:08.89">But this collaborative divorce process makes you actually show up to meetings with your spouse and your lawyers and start talking. And as these two people talked, they started to see each other's side of things. Maybe he hadn't been around enough. Maybe she could have been more supportive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:49:22.80">I think the turning point came when they were talking about what to do with the house, and each one kind of recognized that they didn't really want to be living anywhere without the other person.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:38.39">Usually, of course, the spouses do not get back together. When the process works, Barry Berkman says, at least they end up feeling a little better about each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:49:46.46">Do people ever say at the end of this process, they appreciate your help and they're glad for the results, but they're still full of pain?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:49:55.40">Yeah. I mean, we're not going to get rid of the pain. The pain is there. Long marriages, the pain is there. I think going through this process enables people to get in touch with that pain and the real sadness that they're experiencing, which is sometimes covered up by their anger.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:15.83">Are you saying that at the end of this process, actually just going through the dividing of assets-- which is really, in the end, all you're trying to do-- actually makes people's anger dissipate? When you do it this way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Berkman</h4><p begin="00:50:28.97">I think going through the process where we reach-- and it's not just the assets. The assets are usually relatively easy. Don't forget we have the kids and the parenting and the decision making. And that's often a lot tougher.</p><p begin="00:50:43.61">I think, going through the process where people reach points of understanding where maybe for the first time they get a glimpse of where the other person is coming from-- And so all of a sudden, they realize, you know what? It's not necessary to demonize this person anymore. And when they have those moments of understanding, it goes a long way toward helping them get on with the rest of their lives, actually.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:12.64">Barry Berkman is a lawyer in New York and on the board of the New York Association of Collaborative Professionals.

  <h3>Act Four. Divorce Is Rrruuffff!</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:34.25">Act Four: Divorce is Rrruuffff. We close our show today with this vignette of just how lost you feel when you lose somebody, from Merrill Markoe, recorded on stage at Un-Cabaret in Los Angeles.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Merrill Markoe</h4><p begin="00:51:47.77">Today, our friend Paul came to the house in a near dissociative state of panic. Suddenly and without warning, it appeared that his marriage was unraveling. He sat down on the big, red couch in the living room. And I offered him a vodka as he started detailing his anguish.</p><p begin="00:52:02.53">"Up until yesterday, if you'd asked me if my marriage was a happy one, I would've said yes," he said, choking back tears. "And then, last night, out of the blue, my wife comes in and tells me she wants a divorce." As Paul spoke, Andy's dog, Puppy Boy, a skinny, brown and black Tijuana shepherd, approached with his mouth full of a large, black, completely deflated soccer ball. He placed the flat, wet piece of rubber gently on Paul's knee, and then sat down right in front of him to wait for the games to begin.</p><p begin="00:52:32.16">Paul was too upset to notice. "She told me she wants to start seeing other men," Paul said, tears welling up in his eyes. "And that's not even the worst of it. Today, I found out from friends, they've already seen her around town with another guy. They didn't want to say anything until now." He began to cry. And as he did, Puppy Boy attempted to apply a little additional pressure by picking up the deflated piece of rubber off Paul's knee and moving it to a new spot a little further up Paul's leg.</p><p begin="00:53:00.81">But Paul had the bad manners to be completely preoccupied by his own tragedy. "I have no idea what I'm going to do," he said, as Puppy Boy moved in a little closer and began staring a little harder, his eyes going intently from the black, flat, rubber thing that was now balancing on Paul's thigh, to Paul's face, and then back to the flat, black, rubber thing, as if to help Paul out in case he was having trouble locating it.</p><p begin="00:53:26.14">"It's been just emotionally devastating," Paul continued. "Everything I've worked for is falling apart. And what happens to me now? Am I going to lose everything? My house? My cars? My savings?" He broke down and began to sob, the only time I've ever seen this incredibly stoic man cry. Which was a signal to Puppy Boy that the game was finally about to get going.</p><p begin="00:53:45.75">So he picked up the deflated soccer ball off Paul's thigh and moved it to the most conveniently located spot of all, the very center of Paul's lap. Then, he sat back down in front of Paul and resumed his intense staring. So he kept doing this for the whole two hours that Paul was at our house.</p><p begin="00:54:01.93">Later that night, after Paul had gone home to pick up the pieces of his shattered existence, I began to wonder what Puppy Boy might have to say for himself about this behavior. So I asked him. Puppy Boy replies, "Hello, new seated person. I am Puppy Boy. And I can see that you are very upset for some reason. But I have something on my mind. I'm going out on a limb here and tell you that it is the most important thing I have ever had to say. And it is this: I have placed a thing on you that you must throw. [LAUGHTER] If you look down now, you will see it. It is that large, flat thing that is balancing on your knee.</p><p begin="00:54:46.32">Please listen to me when I tell you that this is an opportunity you cannot pass up. By the way, you have noticed that your knee has a big, flat, wet thing balancing on it, haven't you? Or are you so busy sobbing and weeping and talking about yourself that you are having trouble seeing it? Here's a hint. I'm staring at it right now. So if you can imagine a laser beam coming from my eyes, and then follow it down to the spot on your leg where it is focused, it'll lead you right to it.</p><p begin="00:55:15.38">The only other possible explanation for your puzzling lack of interest is that you are purposefully ignoring me. And why would you do that? Especially since you are really hurting yourself more than you are hurting me. Because let's face it, you're the one who's passing up a great opportunity. And by a great opportunity, I'm referring to the chance to have the kind of fun that everyone dreams of having. I speak of the chance to throw a big, flat, stretchy, wet thing. And guess where it is right now? Throw it now or live a life of regret.</p><p begin="00:55:49.94">I mean, I can't stop you if you'd rather just listen to yourself talk. Wife, wife, wife. She did this. She did that. Really fascinating. For Christ's sakes, look into my eyes and play along. Pick up the big, flat, wet thing. Pick it up. Pick up the big, flat, wet thing. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick up the big, flat, wet thing. Can you hear me OK? Pick up the big, flat, wet thing.</p><p begin="00:56:11.23">Are you even listening? You know, maybe if you had listened a little better during your marriage, your wife wouldn't want a divorce. Did you ever think of that? It wouldn't surprise me if you never threw the things she brought you either." Thank you.
