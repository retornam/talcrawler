He doesn't even want to sit next to him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:00:26.63">He's pinching your cheek right now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:29.94">Pressure pointing, actually.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:00:31.50">So do you feel like this is always going to be your job. As you guys get older, you're always going to be the brother sitting in the middle, brokering the peace?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:40.73">Yeah. And basically, I'm the mediator.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:00:44.46">How do you mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:46.67">I'm not sure what you're talking about.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:00:49.00">How do you mean you're the mediator?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boy</h4><p begin="00:00:51.72">I'm actually not sure what mediator mean, I just felt like saying it. I think it means a guy who keeps peace. Like keeping them from killing each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:01:02.04">They can use a guy like you in the Middle East, maybe.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:04.82">One of the little brothers signals for the microphone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Little Brother</h4><p begin="00:01:06.29"> Get it?

Middle East.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:24.01">There's nothing particularly notable about this rest stop. It's one of thousands all over the country. The kind of place where you'd stop for 10 minutes on a holiday weekend, run inside, use the restroom, by a burger or a coffee. Head back out on the road. But if you stayed for more than 10 minutes, you might end up talking to one of these kids. Or to one of the couples who are dropping off children at college, like this reporter did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:01:43.71"> --the  last kid off to school, so now we're the new empty-nesters right now.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:01:46.61">How do you feel about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:01:48.51"> I'm cooking things that I've never tried.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dad</h4><p begin="00:01:50.77"> And I'm eating things that I've never tried.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:53.04"> There's some folks on the way back from a family reunion, might complain about traffic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:56.74"> --and suddenly a clown truck, filled with clowns, caught us off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:00.84">Or there's this guy, whose entertainment on his weekly four hour drive isn't the radio or the CD player.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Driver</h4><p begin="00:02:06.45"> Well, truthfully, so none of the police folk out there are listening, I usually read the newspaper on the way up.

A young couple looking for a place to have their wedding. Two brothers on their way to compete in the rodeo. A 16-year-old standing inside the rest stop, nursing a tea, taking a break from her own family. She's on an eight-hour car trip with her dad, her grandma, her sister, and a couple brother. She explains to a reporter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Teenage Girl</h4><p begin="00:02:43.57"> Well, it's very noisy, you could say that. Because everybody's arguing, or talking about sports. We were just having an argument on who's better, Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson? And Mike Tyson won. My dad nearly stopped the car to argue and say, "No, Mike Tyson is better. So it was just very hectic.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:02.15">Coincidentally, a little later, Mike Tyson's name comes up again, in conversation with a prep cook named Ozzy, who works at the rest stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ozzy</h4><p begin="00:03:08.86"> Sometimes I see movie stars.

We thought that, for once, we would not leave after just 10 minutes. We'd stick around and find out who all these people are. Where they're going. What they're thinking about. We found love stories, and hard core partiers, and inexplicably angry people. And all kinds of others. We bring you those stories in this special hour of our show. For this holiday weekend, when so many of us are on the road.</p><p begin="00:04:15.14">From WBEZ, Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>, distributed by Public Radio International.

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:05:07.82"> I think we have a very strong weekend as we get into the end of summer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:12.29">This is that general manager, Robert Woodhill, a friendly, upbeat guy who carries a folded piece of paper that he pulls out and unfolds and refers to constantly through the day, which has a list of sales figures for every half hour of the day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:05:25.16"> All it simply is is it's my half hour reports of last year on this day, so I can compare my sales to last year and see where we're at. We do it usually, like, 11 o'clock. And then every hour or so, we take a quick reading just to see where we're at.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:38.82"> And explain, when is the crazy time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:05:41.05"> Today, it'll be probably from like 12 o'clock till 7 o'clock. Very solid and steady, and then tomorrow morning it will pick up again. And I think as we're getting to the end of summer-- there's a big race in Saratoga this week, people have booked their rooms for Lake George. And it's the end of summer. People want to go and go on vacation. So I think we're going to have a good weekend.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:59.30"> We were there taping on Friday and Saturday, two weeks before Labor Day. Just two weeks ago. Because those are the biggest days, in the biggest month here. In August, the rest stop makes a fourth of its money for the whole year. And it's crucial that Robert makes his goals this weekend, because it's built into the rest stop business that there are a couple months every year when it just breaks even, or loses money.</p><p begin="00:06:19.92">Also, he wants to do better than his rival. His rival. A rest stop in Maine, run by a guy named Andy Tucci.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:06:26.36"> Anabac north, usually, and I are neck and neck. We never place any wagers, but, you know, they're Red Sox fans, we're Yankee fans. And we go back and forth on that as well as discussing who is going to have the record sales for the day.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:40.25">Who won last weekend?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:06:42.15"> Andy. Andy beat me red like a lobster, if you want it. That's what I told him. He beat me both days, but I think I'm going to get it back this weekend. I hope this week, the Yankees sweep the Red Sox and then he'll be really quiet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:53.84"> Robert was fully staffed for the rush, he had his best cashiers on. And now he just needed the crowds. The big summer weekend crowds.</p><p begin="00:07:11.93">We chose this particular rest stop because a couple years ago, I came here on the way to a wedding and I noticed that a couple of the college students working at the Starbucks were speaking Polish. When I asked, they said, yeah, they were from Poland. Here for the summer, on a special Visa program called the J-1 program, where they live in the United States and work for three months at the rest stop. And then get to travel for a month in America before flying home.</p><p begin="00:07:32.94">And it seemed like such a crazy thing to fly all the way to America and then be stuck behind a counter in the middle of nowhere for the summer. I wondered if they felt cheated. I wanted to come back and find out.</p></div><div class="subect"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:07:45.21"> I'm Sandy, and I'm from Taiwan. And I work at Starbucks in Plattekill Travel Plaza.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:51.19"> There are no Polish students this summer. It's mostly Taiwanese and Ukrainians working in Plattekill. Sandy's name back home is Moche Cho. She's a college junior, an English major. This is her second year doing this summer work program. Last year she was one of hundreds of foreign students who get jobs at Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio. But this year, she wanted to see a different part of the country. And signed up for this location because of two magic words: New York.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:08:14.74"> I love New York. Last year, I went to New York City just three days. So this time, I want to stay in New York City more.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:23.95">And then, when you got here, were you surprised how far it was from New York City?</p></div><div class="subect"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:08:28.90">Yes, very surprised. Yeah. So, actually, I'm a little regret about I choose this place, yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:37.36">She knew the rest stop wasn't in New York City, she just thought it would be a little closer and easier to get to. Without a car, everything's a hassle. So she hasn't seen New York at all this summer. The only place she's gone is some outlet stores. When she's not a work, she hangs around the apartment with five other students, all women, who came over from Asia this summer to work at the rest stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:08:56.72"> When we have day off, we will go to a supermarket to buy grocery. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:03.65">That's it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:09:04.14"> Maybe go to a restaurant to eat something.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:09.81">What's the best thing that's happened this summer on your trip?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:09:12.73">This summer? So far I didn't meet happiness thing in this trip, so far, no.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:25.20">Wait, you haven't had much that's been so good this trip?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sandy</h4><p begin="00:09:28.38">No. So far.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:31.04">So this seemed, frankly, a little sad. A bunch of students quietly tolerating their summers, counting the days until they could finally travel the country. Cooking food they don't eat, like hamburgers, and drinks they'd never heard of before arriving here, like Frappucinos. All for people who have cars, at a place that's all about cars, on the side of the highway, but without cars of their own. I felt bad for them.</p><p begin="00:09:53.28">And then I started talking to the Ukrainian students.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:57.25">And how's it going?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:09:58.38"> Very good, I think. I really get a very big, huge experience here because I like this place and I want to come back here. It's really true. I'm happy that I am here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:15.00"> Evgenia Trekasa to goes by the name Jane or Angelina here in the States. She's 18, entering her junior year of college. It's her first time away so long from her parents, and she misses them terribly. But it's also very exciting. She says that in the first week or two in Plattekill, she and the other Ukrainians felt stranded, same as the girls from Taiwan and Hong Kong felt.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:10:33.66"> Because we don't have a car, we can't drive. We just can take a bus, so that's why. But then we find friends that when we have a day off, they always can take us, like say, it's OK, we'll show you beautiful places. So when we have a day off, we always go to somewhere. We never stay at home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:56.52">What happened is that the Ukrainians befriended a couple of the American teenagers who work at the rest stop, and those teenagers introduced them to other young people. And before they knew it, they had rides to the mall, to Six Flags Amusement Park, to New York City.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:11:08.60"> My name is Adelaide Giron, I'm 19. I work at Roy Rogers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:12.78">Adelaide is a big, cheerful, fun-loving guy, and probably the American who's gotten closest to the Ukrainians. In two years of working at the Roy Rogers at the rest stop, he's seen lots of foreign students come through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:11:22.15">I think think group has definitely, by far, been my favorite.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:24.53">Why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:11:25.23"> I felt like the other groups before, I've gotten attach to them. But this group-- I think it's, I'm in college and they're in college. And we drink and I drink and they drink. And it's a fun experience. I just recently got my license, about two years ago. Actually a year and a half ago. Before that I was driving illegally, so I really couldn't drive all over the place. But now that I got my license, like [BLEEP], I'm driving everywhere.</p><p begin="00:11:48.64">So I hang out with them, I take them shopping. At night, we go swimming at this lake. Trespassing. Who cares, though? Just having a good time. We're young. The cops showed up one time. We had alcohol on us. It was a pretty bad story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:03.82">For a while, he says he was going over to their apartment three times a week. Fridays, Saturdays, and Wednesdays for parties. Parties he taught them how to throw. Here's, um, one of his students in this matter, Peter Molov, one of the Ukrainians.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:16.88"> What's your favorite thing that you've done so far since you've been here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter</h4><p begin="00:12:20.35">Favorite thing? Probably the parties. Parties. They're a lot different than our country. If we want to have parties, we just go to the club in our country, in Ukraine. Go to the club. Loud music and stuff. But since we came here, we get to know other Americans, and they said, let's have a party. Well, OK, let's go to the club. Why to the club? Let's do it at home. OK. We got to home, they showed us games they play.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:12:49.96"> Beer pong. Introduced them to my beer funnel, they'd never seen that before. We showed them flip cup, we showed them how to I play flip cup.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:57.77">I don't even know what this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:12:59.22">Really? it's good buzz getter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter</h4><p begin="00:13:03.60">It is fun. A lot of people play, so it's really fun.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:06.73"> And you didn't have beer pong back in Ukraine?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter</h4><p begin="00:13:09.55">No. I never knew.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:12.29">Will you be taking that back to show your friends back home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Peter</h4><p begin="00:13:15.13">Oh yeah. We even want to buy beer pong table, special for it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:21.21">I'm not sure they're called a beer pong table.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:13:23.99">They're pretty good for not knowing what beer pong is. We just introduced them to beer pong two months ago, and yet they're better than me. We actually have tournaments going on sometimes, and the Ukrainians end up being on top most of the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:13:38.07"> It's impossible to drink so much as Americans do. Americans really drink very much.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:13:44.65">This is Dasha, another 19-year-old from Ukraine. She said most of the parties here in America, in their apartment or out by the lake, went until dawn.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:13:51.98"> At 6 AM, 7 AM. And then the most fun is then when you work from 9 AM and you don't sleep at all. Like one day, I just slept 30 minutes, I woke up and went to work.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:06.46">That was the most fun?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:14:09.60">As for me. I was dying at work.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:12.66">Fortunately, she works at a Starbucks.</p><p begin="00:14:14.95">The Plattekill Rest Stop has employed foreign students for nearly a decade. They're hard workers and easier to schedule into shifts than American teenagers, who are always needing time off for family vacations and sports practice and other activities. There's a group in the summer, and then smaller groups in the winter and spring. And the Plattekill Rest Stop is a close knit enough place that people cry when they leave.</p><p begin="00:14:35.08">One of the managers told me she still emails kids from Brazil and Peru who worked here years ago. At least one marriage has come out of this, between an American worker and a Bulgarian girl. Though all the managers of the rest stop agreed that they like the Ukrainians, they're good kids, but the Ukrainians are the rowdiest group with the most issues they have ever had. Hands down. Probably because the Ukrainians are the first group that were friends back in their home country.</p><p begin="00:14:58.72">They came to Plattekill for a summer adventure. "They're having too much fun," one manager told me. Fireworks after 2 AM, complaints from neighbors, the police have come out a few times because of the noise. Robert, the general manager, has no idea where he's going to find them housing if their landlord evicts them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:15:15.06">It's been a little bit of a rough summer with them. They're college kids. And I think the thing is, they forget that they're not living in the dorms. They live in an apartment complex where there's families and kids and little kids. They just have to be more respectful at times. It's not like we don't want them to have a good time, you gotta make sure you draw the line someplace and say OK, maybe 1 o'clock is late enough.</p><p begin="00:15:37.03">And, you know, the people are going to work because it's a Tuesday, and you just got to be good neighbors.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:15:43.12">As it turned out, everything came to a head the night before we arrived to record with an all night party that Adelaide says was their craziest ever. A party that was not thrown by the Ukrainians. It was the very first party thrown by the girls from Taiwan. Total turnaround for them. Adelaide says, before this, he and the Ukrainians had only invited them to one party.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:16:02.94"> And they really don't drink, so they got drunk off a couple of beers and we just-- they couldn't hang, so we just didn't invite them anymore.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:10.93">But now, they threw this party, a goodbye party for one of the girls who was leaving early, and they partied with the best of them. Everybody dancing and making noise. After the second beer run, there was a late night beer fight with people pouring their drinks on each other. As usual, all this bothering the neighbors.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:26.73">Then what was it? They complained to the landlord?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:16:28.28">Yeah. The landlord doesn't like me or my other friends hanging around there. He actually refers to me as a big, crazy Mexican that walks around. So I don't know. I don't think I'm a big, crazy Mexican at all. I'm a gentle giant, really.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:16:43.44">And so then Robert had the talk with everybody?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:16:45.39">Yeah. He had a talk with everybody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:16:47.68">It was time to play the heavy-handed Dad and just to make sure that they get the full message that this can't go on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:16:54.77">And that we shouldn't have any more parties here. We should be quiet because if there will be one more party, they will send us home. They will break our contact with Plaza and then there will be no more students in Plaza the next year.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:11.27">And what do you think of that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dasha</h4><p begin="00:17:13.97">I don't know. I don't really care if they will have any other students next summer. Because I won't be there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:23.49">The American kids also got a warning from their boss. Again, here's Adelaide.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:17:28.00">Just to stop going over there, the landlord doesn't want me on his property. He sees me or my car, it's getting towed at my expense. I'm going to get charged for trespassing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:38.90">And so what are you going to do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:17:41.15">Well, I'll probably still go over. [BLEEP] it. There's really nothing-- if they say anything, I'll just be like, OK, it won't happen again, officer. And, of course, it will happen again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:17:55.43">And do you worry that you could get the Ukrainians in trouble in a way that they'd get sent back early?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adelaide</h4><p begin="00:18:01.12">I hope not, but if they do, it's all a good time. And I told them that if anything happens, I'm deeply sorry. But whatever happens, happens. There's nothing we can do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:10.87">And that, everybody says, is the last big party of the year. But no matter. It was still a great summer. I asked Evgenia if she ever felt jealous of all the travelers she saw pass through the rest stop. People on the way to vacations while she was stuck working. And she said never. She'd come so far to get here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:18:28.74">They should be jealous of me. Because I'm here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:18:46.87">Inside the rest stop, right when you enter the lobby, between the bathroom and the food court, is this room full of racks of brochures.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:18:53.90">Lisa Pollak is one of the gang of nine reporters that we had at Plattekill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:18:57.73">You know those brochures you'll see in the lobby of a discount hotel? The ones advertising local attractions that inevitably, no matter where in the country you are, include a water park and underground cavern tour? It's that. Floor to ceiling. This is the New York state information center. It, confusingly, is run not by New York state, but by a private company that charges businesses to display their pamphlets here.</p><p begin="00:19:20.17">The manager of the center is a guy named Lenny Wheat. He also stands behind a counter, offering travel advice to the lost. When I talk to Lenny, he gets this look on his face, almost like he feels a little sorry for me. Because I think I'm in the middle of nowhere and he thinks I have no idea what I'm missing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:19:37.22">Right here, at the next exit alone, you have best rock climbing in the country here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:19:42.46">Seriously?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:19:43.40">Yeah. It's the Napa valley of the east around here. We have the oldest vineyards, the oldest winery. One of the best wineries. You have the best hotel resort spa in the United States in the area here, too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:19:55.17">Wait, how do you know it's the best?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:19:56.68">That's according to the <i>Mobil</i> <i>Travel</i> <i>Guide</i> and <i>Day</i> <i>Spa</i> <i>Magazine</i>. I got one of the best dude ranches in the country up here by New Paltz, too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:20:04.67">No you don't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:20:05.29">Yes. Rocking Horse Ranch Resort. Great place to take a family.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:20:09.95">By the time Lenny tells me about something called the Catamount Adventure Park-- largest adventure park in North America, according to the brochure--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:20:16.81">There's 120 things to do there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:20:19.11">I am so overwhelmed by superlatives that I just take his word for it. Lenny knows this area. He's a local. Lives eight minutes away. And he used to drive for a messenger service, so he's an expert in giving directions. I found it especially impressive when he told travelers the exact number of miles between highway exits by memory.</p><p begin="00:20:37.87">But Lenny actually ended up in this job by accident. His neighbor used to work here, and Lenny would visit him from time to time to help out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:20:45.28">And he was feeling ill one day. And I was like, he says, you think you can stay here and do this? And I'm like, sure, why not? I mean, I know my way around. I know the roads, so. And he had some issues, diabetes and stuff, and wound up taking timeout and stuff. He recently passed away and stuff. But, you know. Kind of like, sometimes you feel like what you've done in your life-- when it comes together, it's like you were meant to do something, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:21:11.98">So you're saying it kind of seemed like it was meant to be?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:21:14.30">Yeah, sometimes it feels that way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:21:16.93">I hung out with Lenny for a couple hours. I saw him cheerfully field dozens of information requests. Everything from where to buy beer-- nowhere at the rest stop, but try New Paltz, there's a lot of college kids there-- to how to get to Maryland-- crucial first step, turn around. Maryland is south of here, you are headed north. When anyone wanders in to browse, Lenny pounces.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:21:39.18">What's your destination of today?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:21:40.86">"Lake George," the guy says.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:21:42.54">OK, can I get you anything for Lake George? We just got in the Fall Events guide, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tourist</h4><p begin="00:21:47.57"> Sure, if you want to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:21:48.27">Anything for Washington county, on the other side of the lake? Anything on hiking?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tourist</h4><p begin="00:21:53.32"> No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:21:53.96">Waterways? Whitewater rafting?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tourist</h4><p begin="00:21:56.26"> Waterways.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:21:57.32">Waterways, OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:21:58.92">Even though all these places are paying to advertise here, Lenny gets genuinely excited when he's pitching them. If he doesn't believe the Plattekill Rest Stop is the gateway to vacation gold, he sure fooled me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:22:10.23">And if he didn't know it, in Karo, there's bear statues all around the village, and there's treasure hunt going on with that. OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:22:18.34">Here's another one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:22:19.02">And that is also the best concert facility in the world. Loggins and Messina's playing tonight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:22:24.49"> Who?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:22:25.15">Loggins and Messina.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:22:26.03"> Messina the comedien?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:22:28.55">No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:22:29.97">And one more.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:22:30.91">And the world's largest kaleidoscope there, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:22:32.85"> Oh, beautiful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lisa Pollak</h4><p begin="00:22:34.42">At a time when people plan their trips on computers, and drive to them using GPS, it's a little surprising that a place like this even exists. I actually watched Lenny pull out a magnifying glass for a guy having trouble seeing a map. By the time I left, Lenny had me almost convinced that what he has to offer is better than the Internet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lenny Wheat</h4><p begin="00:22:52.55">You can see here, in 10, 15 minutes look through the pages, and see most everything every county might have to offer you. You know how long it would take you to find all that on the Internet? You turn the page, you got shopping. You turn the page, you got your fishing, your antiquing, you know.</p><p begin="00:23:10.40">How you doing, guys? Where you going to?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:16.41">You know, you don't really go on a long car trip with strangers. Usually you're with people who you know really, really well. And being confined in a car together, in a tiny space, staring ahead at the road, it's one of the nicest places to talk. Have a long, long talk. One woman told us that she actually plans things to discuss with her husband and her kids when she knows that they're going to be in the car for hours.</p><p begin="00:23:40.28">Another woman, this mom named Elizabeth McMann, was driving from DC to Albany wit her nine-year-old. It's a long drive. And the son decided that he was going to use the time to get to the bottom of some things.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elizabeth</h4><p begin="00:23:51.98">He's been on this whole Q and A thing. Where, mom, who do you like better, your sister or your brother? Uncle Jenny or uncle Chad? Or how long would you cry if I died? Or would you rather be married to your boyfriend or to daddy, who's-- we're divorced. It's been kind of weird. So that stimulates some conversation. He just asked, for example, mom are you really Santa Claus?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:18.88">The reporter who talked to that woman was Jonathan Goldstein. He mostly has stationed himself outside the rest stop, in the parking lot by the picnic benches. Somehow everybody Jonathan talked to seemed to be enjoying their time on the road to the max.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:24:35.37">Stan is sitting on the bench in front of the parking lot. Unlike everyone else you see, people looking to eat, looking to get to a washroom, Stan looks perfectly at home, smoking a cigar like he's got the world on a string. Like hanging out a rest stop is the best part of any vacation. He's waiting for his girlfriend, who he likes to call--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stan</h4><p begin="00:24:55.28">The war department.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:24:57.25">And, by which, you mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stan</h4><p begin="00:24:59.02">It's my girlfriend. The war department, or the wife is the war department. Get with it baby, let's go baby. You know, it's always-- the sky is very clear and blue today. That's not blue. That's not blue, it's not clear.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:25:12.41">Have you guys been arguing a lot in the car?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stan</h4><p begin="00:25:13.92">No, we never argue. She told me to say that. This is me. See this, under the thumb. Yes, dear. Yes, dear. That's me, right there. Yes, dear.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:25:28.79">And yet, in spite of Stan's take on couplehood, one, perhaps, modeled on Warner Brother cartoons of the 50s, it looks like there's still a never ending line of people all too eager to sign up. Case in point. A group of four women come striding across the parking lot in the midst of a bachelorette party.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:25:48.34">It's a surprise, because it's a bachelorette party. We're taking her away somewhere she's never been before.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:25:53.86">And how do you feel about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bachelorette</h4><p begin="00:25:55.72">I feel like I need to know where I'm going pretty soon.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:26:00.14">Do you even know in what direction you're heading?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bachelorette</h4><p begin="00:26:02.37">North.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:26:03.97">And that's it? That's all you know?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bachelorette</h4><p begin="00:26:05.41">Well, the only thing I know is that I need flip flops, a whistle, and something else. Flip flops and a whistle.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:26:13.96">Now does that really come into play, or are you just messing with her mind at this point?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:26:18.57">It's very important. It's very important to the whole evening.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:26:20.84">Flip flops and a whistle. I'm thinking some--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:26:23.69">And comfortable clothes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:26:25.56">All right, now I'm going to ask you guys-- I'll ask you to step over there. I'm going to ask these guys what they got planned. I won't tell anything. By the time this airs, it won't make a difference. So you're just going to go stand over there. I'm sorry. Because now I'm going to get the scoop. All right. Just crowd in here. All right. So flip flops and a whistle, what's that all about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:26:45.93">It's all crap. It's complete crap, we're making the whole thing up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:26:56.72"> My name's Jack, man.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:26:59.09">And where you coming from?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:27:00.21">I'm coming from [BLEEP] Boston, heading to West Virginia.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:27:04.81">What's your last name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:27:06.75">I ain't getting into that right now. No last names on this. I've been drinking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:27:11.88">As it turns out, Jack is not the one driving. He's traveling with a couple friends back from [BLEEP] Boston, where he's dropped off his four-year-old, who he spent the summer with in West Virginia. Jack has four kids in three different states. Each of their names are tattooed across his upper torso. Jack is on his way home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:27:31.48"> Got lost a couple times, you know, so. Took us, like, 12 hours.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:27:36.47">So, how long was he with you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:27:38.64">Probably like three or four months.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:27:41.13">And you only get to see him during the summer?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:27:44.07">I get him for Christmas. You know how the women are. They don't want to pay for all the Christmas presents and stuff. You know what I mean? They all make sure the kids are with me for Christmas.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:27:53.75">And you saw his mom, too, when you pick him up and drop him off?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:27:57.93">Oh yeah, I still got the big red marks on my back where she tried to beat me up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:28:03.61">Are you kidding?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:28:04.35">No man. I'm for real. Don't bring your new girlfriend to your ex-wife's house. That's all I got to say. That baby's mama drama stuff, you know. She's on crutches. She broke her leg a few weeks ago. She tried to beat me up with her crutches. You know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:28:23.50">Your new girlfriend's in the car with you now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jack</h4><p begin="00:28:25.40">Yeah, man. That's the pretty blonde over there in that black car. You walk over there, you'd be surprised, though. Her and my buddy driving, we call him Hot Wheels. He's a handicapped kid in a wheelchair, so, you know, we nicknamed his ass Hot Wheels.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:28:40.86">I walk across the parking lot to a big, black, rusty car.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jonathan Goldstein</h4><p begin="00:28:44.76">Jack told me they call you Hot Wheels?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hot Wheels</h4><p begin="00:28:46.94">Yeah, cause I'm always in a wheelchair.

Friday. Robert, the general manager of the rest stop, checks his BlackBerry for an email from his rival, in Maine. Andy Tucci. Noon to 3:00 was supposed to be some of the busiest hours of the year for Robert, but he does not look happy. He's not hitting the half hourly goals in that piece of paper that he carries around with him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:31:20.81">I am down a bunch from last year. About $3300 behind last year and $600 behind last week. Which is not a normal thing. So, it's a little cause for concern right now. So right now, we're not sure why. There doesn't seem to be a lot of traffic problems. We can make it up-- in an hour and a half we could make it all back and be right where we're supposed to be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:44.83">Every couple of hours when I check with Robert, this is what he says, "We can still make it up.

Because now they've been in traffic a little longer, so. Perfect timed rainstorms would be nice. And maybe not too hard. I think that'd be good. Because people will get out of their car and walk in a light rain. But they don't want to walk in a downpour. If it's a downpour, they don't come out of the car.</p><p begin="00:32:35.72">We'll keep our fingers crossed.

The kind that if it could just please one person on this earth, and that person was in Maine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andy Tucci</h4><p begin="00:33:05.17"> I would say, probably, by his last email, we're probably right in the same boat.

This is where speed becomes crucial. Robert says that if people walk into the rest stop and see a line, and if the line doesn't seem like it's moving, they'll walk out without buying. So his staff has to pour it on during the rush if they're going to make their goals and, of course, beat Maine.</p><p begin="00:34:27.57">Sean Cole went behind the Nathan's counter to watch the action.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:34:32.32">Every now and then during the rush, Nathan's runs out of food.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:34:35.39"> Wow, there's only one corn dog.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:34:37.08">Heather Rafertee's working one of three cash registers.

Heather has to grab parts of other people's orders just to keep the flow going.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:34:52.39">I'm taking one of your large fries. You're waiting on others anyway.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:34:56.83">It's like putting together a puzzle where a lot of the pieces are exactly the same shape. And it would be easy if it wasn't so hard. People are fanatical about Nathan's and workers joke about it. They feel like saying, "You know, Roy Rogers has food too." Luckily, Heather's break is imminent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:35:12.62">In four minutes. Four long minutes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:35:17.11">Four long minutes later, she clocks out, and snakes through the maze-y hallway in the back. On her way out the back door for a smoke, she walks up to another worker--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:35:25.02"> Alex.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:35:25.72">And gives him a quick passing smooch, which made me feel like I was really behind the scenes. Alex is Heather's boyfriend. About four months ago, they had a kid. A little boy. I ask what it's like to live and work together, but Heather says they don't. She lives with her parents right now. And the baby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:35:42.22">And Alex lives with his family. We're still together, definitely. We plan on moving in together at some point, it's just that right now money tight, and this was kind of-- as much as I love my son, he was kind of a surprise, so. But eventually, down the road, me and Alex will move in with each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:35:58.28">And you're thinking of getting married and--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:36:00.90">I'm hoping so. We've been together for two years now, so I'm definitely considering it, but. He's 20 years old.

She works at Nathan's. He works at Brioche Duree, the pastry and sandwich shop at the rest stop. This has led to a little inter-restaurant tension in the relationship.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:36:24.11">He's like, well, I worked this shift. And I'm like, well I worked this shift and it was busy like this. And he's like, well, it was like this. We get into debates.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:36:31.15">Over who is more busy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Heather</h4><p begin="00:36:32.34">Yeah. And which one's more crazier and which one's more harder, so.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:36:36.77">I've not been privy to these debates, and I don't work at the rest stop. But no one's fanatical about Brioche Doree.

It's a simple maneuver that blocks and redirects the flow of customers. Without it, she'd get bombarded from both sides.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clara Dragon</h4><p begin="00:37:18.11">Because they'll come over here ahead of the other people and it causes an argument. So I barricade it so that they know they got to go over there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Gregory Warner</h4><p begin="00:37:27.09">This stack of two ounce Purell--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clara Dragon</h4><p begin="00:37:30.36">Keeps them from standing here and cutting the people off. Everyone says I'm crazy, but I do it immediately when I come in. Because it saves arguments. You don't want to rile them up, more than they already are.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Gregory Warner</h4><p begin="00:37:46.83">Clara grew up in a rough part of Astoria, Queens, and spent her youth staying out of the way of trouble. At Plattekill she's worked nine years, as waitress, and then cashier.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Clara Dragon</h4><p begin="00:37:56.81">I was a waitress in Bob's Big Boy.

And do you think you deserve it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Gregory Warner</h4><p begin="00:38:22.24">Clara looks up at the angry man. She wears bifocals and shimmery eye shadow. She doesn't say anything. She just smiles. It's a smile so genuine that the man can't help himself. He smiles back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:38:35.24"> Well, I don't like the Democrats in general--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Gregory Warner</h4><p begin="00:38:36.70">The guy continues talking politics, but less belligerently.

Not all the time, but sometimes. They're battling the roads or this heat or traffic, especially. They're coming in fuming. They're even rough with their families. You know, so. You just say, oh, I'm sorry. I rush to get them out so that they don't have to be any longer than possible. I only had one run in with someone, a while back, who got on my goat and I yelled back at him.

I said, "I'm doing a fax for someone, it's important." "No, it's not," he says. "I don't give a heck what you're doing down there. I'm going to report you," he says. "And it's going to make my day."

Very optimistic.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:50:45.52">In the parking lot, when I first saw Stevie G. from a distance, I thought he was naked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G.</h4><p begin="00:50:50.86"> Right now, I'm de-kinking the muscles in my buttock.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:50:54.80"> Then he kicked one leg in the air above his head and I saw he was wearing little white gym shoes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G.</h4><p begin="00:51:01.53">It opens up the fountain of youth in the front of the hip joint.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:04.82">And then he jumped into a pool of light, and I saw he actually had on some tiny black nylon shorts. Stevie G. teaches body work, pilates, yoga, massage and such, and he's stopped at this rest stop to stretch and move. It's hard not to notice though, that while Stevie is working out in the parking lot, he is simultaneously smoking a hand-rolled cigarette.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G.</h4><p begin="00:51:29.67">It's what I am, you know. Unfortunately, I'm polluting my lungs. They're doing well, you know. I clean them out on a daily basis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:37.86">How do you clean them out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G.</h4><p begin="00:51:40.26">Usually a mixture of running and steaming and meditational breathing. And not swallowing what I cough up. I always spit it out. Like I have a little cup, I can spit out all that-- I never swallow it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:51:55.62">Our conversation, by the way, is happening next to Stevie's vehicle, which figures largely in his life. It's an old yellow school bus he got up in Woodstock to start a volunteer service program.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G.</h4><p begin="00:52:07.47">Picking up the drunk people, like, going into the bars and finding the ones and saying, all right, who looks really bombed, offer them a free ride home.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:52:17.42">But now Stevie G. has a larger vision for the bus. He wants to build a health center made of school buses. Before he leaves the rest up, Stevie G. gets out a big foam roller and takes it to his favorite spot for a final stretch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G.</h4><p begin="00:52:34.53">All right, we got all of the big 18-wheeler trucks on one side. We got all the smaller cars over here, on the other. We are on 87 highway. This is where I think it's the cleanest. You just got to watch out to see if the dogs have been here. Abracadabra. Scoop that belly, burn the jelly, America. You've got to get off of your fat one, and do something good. Something good like the solid oak would. Get out there and help others. And especially, help yourself, to be your best. So that you are not a cranky old fool that we all got to pull up the hill.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:53:12.98">Stevie rolls all around the sidewalk, with truckers looking down at him from their cabs. He doesn't notice. When he's all loosened up, he picks up his roller and heads back to his vehicle.</p><p begin="00:53:23.60">[ENGINE STARTING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stevie G.</h4><p begin="00:53:24.36"> Oh, it sounds good. That's my baby. Take care.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:53:34.30"> Take it easy.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:53:35.80">Stevie G. coughs up some phlegm, spits it out, and heads off for Woodstock.</p><p begin="00:53:57.11">It's morning. English sparrows are congregating like crazy in the trees just outside the rest stop doors. Standing out in the parking lot, nine-year-old Brian Belco looks kind of like a bird, actually. His eyes are bright, his arms are stiff at his sides, and held out a bit like wings. And when he speaks into the microphone, he bobs his head forward, like he's pecking at it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian</h4><p begin="00:54:20.04"> We're going fishing up in Swanton's Mine.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:22.72">Yeah? What are you going to catch?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian</h4><p begin="00:54:24.79">Bass, pike, pickerel, perch.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:28.07">Sounds like you've done this before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian</h4><p begin="00:54:30.52">Yeah. But the tradition started with my family started with my great-grandfather.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:36.59">Is that right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian</h4><p begin="00:54:37.72">My great-grandfather was a great fisherman. He really liked fishing, so-- so he went up to Lake Champlain. And some of the cabins were built right over the historic battlefield of the war in 1842, the Battle of Lake Champlain.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:54:57.71">You're a student.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian</h4><p begin="00:54:59.96">This is my first radio interview ever.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:02.81">Really? You did great.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian</h4><p begin="00:55:04.76">I know. I'm really, really excited.</p></div><div class=""><h4></h4><p begin="00:55:07.28"> Say goodbye.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian</h4><p begin="00:55:08.12"> Bye.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jay Allison</h4><p begin="00:55:08.95">Bye. Have a great vacation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:14.06">And with a new day here, we have just the time for one final note before we go. Final tallies from the battle between the rest stops in Plattekill and Maine. At the end of the afternoon, after our two days in Plattekill, I can report to you that business never really picked up for either rest stop. And, after two days, on Saturday afternoon, Robert told me he only had one consolation for the weekend. He beat Andy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Robert Woodhill</h4><p begin="00:55:37.03">I'm the king for the day. I beat Andy, and the Red Sox got smacked around and massacred by the Yankees. The unfortunate thing is being king for the day when you miss your sales by $7,000 isn't so good. And everybody was down. It was a bad day for everybody. Maine. Andy set out a quick note, not hitting his numbers at all. But, you know, we're ready for next weekend. Still got two more weekends to go. I still think they're coming. In this business, you've got to be positive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:06.09">When I left, he was around $12,000 down for two days. 7% or 8% lower than where he needed to be. But, all this rain, he said, could make for really beautiful leaves upstate come the fall. A lot of people could get on the roads for that. To look at those leaves. He could still turn this around.</p><p begin="00:56:36.53">Our program was produced today by Sean Cole, myself, with Alex Blumberg, Jane Feltes, Sarah Koenig, Lisa Pollak, Alyssa Shipp, and Nancy Updike.
