How are you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:00:07.18"> Good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:08.09"> Before we go any further, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life,</i> distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Sarah Koenig sitting in for Ira Glass. And you're about to hear this story the same way I did-- blind. All I know is that it's going to have a coincidence in it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:23.58">I have no idea what you're about to tell me. So yeah, lay it on me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:00:27.82"> So the story is, I was a freshman in high school at Bozeman High School.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:34.52"> Oh, in Montana.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:00:35.42"> Yes, and I was in the orchestra and it was early in my freshman year. And I had made friends in high school, but didn't really have orchestra friends yet. And we were taking an orchestra trip, so that was a little nerve-wracking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:00:52.49"> When you're a freshman, this qualifies as a demi-crisis. A long bus ride to Seattle. Sharing a hotel room with someone you don't know.</p><p begin="00:00:59.43">But there's this one girl, Lindsay. She and Hannah have friends in common. So they decide to pair up-- to room together, ride the bus together, to be orchestra friends.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:07.01"> So we go to Seattle and we're like, it's awkward, because we're new friends, trying to get to know each other.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:15.13">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:15.59"> And on one of our free days, they send us to the Space Needle. And I don't know if you've ever been to the Space Needle.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:21.72">I have.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:22.04"> But there's that carnival area all around it. And we were playing the little games all around there and we won Poopatroopers. Do you know what those are?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:32.88">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:34.63"> They're like the little plastic soldiers that have a plastic parachute. And you're supposed to drop them from somewhere and the plastic parachute expands.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:45.34"> Oh. What did you call them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:47.25"> Poopatroopers.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:01:48.53"> Really?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:01:50.82">I didn't quite believe Hannah about this, but she looked it up. It's true, Poopatroopers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:01:55.39"> I just did a Google image search for Poopatroopers, and I'm seeing images of the little guys.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:01.30">But wait, is it a generic name or is it a brand name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:04.02">I think it's a brand name. I think, from what I'm seeing here, Imperial Poopatroopers, maybe?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:10.17"> His Highness, Four-Star General Poopatrooper.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:14.12"> Yes, exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:17.67"> Back to the plot here. Hannah and her new friend Lindsay go to the top of the Seattle Space Needle to try out their prizes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:23.42"> So we got in the little elevator and ran to the top and ran to the edge and threw the Poopatroopers over the edge, because there's nothing to stop you, really. And we were just in peals of laughter, and we thought it was so hilarious. And it sort of broke the ice in our friendship.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:02:42.06"> Lindsay and Hannah become best friends all through high school. Cut to senior year, four years later. Another orchestra trip, this time to Reno, Nevada. Hannah and Lindsay are in their hotel room, studying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:02:53.56"> And so Lindsay and I are both sitting at the desk in this hotel room in Reno, Nevada, and a Poopatrooper comes flying out of the sky and lands on the windowsill of our hotel room. And we both couldn't believe it. We opened the window and we grabbed the Poopatrooper.</p><p begin="00:03:13.35">And we ran into the hall to try to find other people in our orchestra. We thought someone had been playing a trick on us. But no one knew what we were talking about. No one even remembered the thing in Seattle. And so I still to this day don't know why that happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:03:34.94"> Every once in a while, we get pitches like this at the radio show-- coincidence stories. And since they don't really fit into our usual every week we bring you a theme format, we've been setting them aside, wondering what to do with them. They mean so much to people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Hannah Jacoby</h4><p begin="00:03:48.80"> I don't know. It felt like it was about our friendship. I'm not someone that believes in God, really, but it felt a little bit like an act of God or something, like just sort of cosmic and larger than us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:04:09.50"> Finally it hit us. If we got enough of them, we could put them on the radio as their own thing. So we put out a call to listeners-- send us your coincidence stories. And you did. Hundreds and hundreds of you did. We've read at least 1,300 coincidence stories, interviewed dozens of people. Here are just a few things we've learned.</p><p begin="00:04:27.81">You're most prone to coincidences when you're young-- teens or 20s. Lots of coincidences involve your grandmother. You're likely to experience a coincidence if you're in or near the Netherlands. Coincidences also happen to you in or near airplanes or on Craigslist. For many of you, coincidences were the answer to your prayers or helped you find your missing bike.</p><p begin="00:04:46.25">Also, there are coincidences hidden in your name, your keys, your clothes, your address. Like when Flora and Ragaciano Pena first started dating.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Flora Pena</h4><p begin="00:04:55.39"> When we met, he said that he was born in [INAUDIBLE] and I said well, I was, too. And then when we were going to get married and we needed our birth certificates, we compared them and it was the same building.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:05:13.72"> We heard stories about a lost roll of film discovered, coincidentally, in the stomach of a decomposing hyena. About the man who got his favorite t-shirt back from a stranger's knapsack, in Slovakia. About the woman who was dating not one, but two Mark Steven Andersons, at the same time. About the student whose car broke down in rush hour on a busy highway. And the one person who just happens to stop, who comes to her rescue, it's her dad who lives four hours away.</p><p begin="00:05:42.29">And one of my favorites, from a woman named Jill Peterson who felt nauseated on the subway in New York City. As they pull into the Second Avenue stop, there's a garbage can perfectly positioned to help her out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jill Peterson</h4><p begin="00:05:52.90"> So the train doors open and I'm beelining it for this can. And as I get there, out of the corner of my eye I kind of see another person heading my direction, kind of going for the can, too.</p><p begin="00:06:07.38">And it's all coming up, and I'm throwing up. And as I'm throwing up in this can, this person that was coming towards me starts throwing up in the can, too. And we're both simultaneously barfing into this can in the subway station.</p><p begin="00:06:22.10">And we kind of look at each other and think, whoa, I don't know. How are you feeling? And she's like, oh, I'm feeling a little bit better now. And I'm like, me, too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:06:32.84"> What's the only way to survive throwing up in front of a subway car full of strangers? Have a nice girl your age do it with you. And numbers-- so many coincidences with numbers. One woman told us how she was at Thanksgiving with her extended family and then suddenly realized that six of them had the exact same number of letters in their names-- 23 letters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Catherine Van De Putte</h4><p begin="00:06:52.26">[?  ?] Michael Arthur van de Putte, Mary Elizabeth van de Putte, William Arthur an de Putte.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:06:58.29"> There was the guy at the mall doing surveys who had to ask people their phone number. It's obvious the guy he's surveying starts to make up a number. He says 933, 456.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:07:09.31"> When he read out that last number, he said 8? And I kind of stepped back for a second. But I was cool, and I said no, sir, I'm sorry. That's not your phone number.</p><p begin="00:07:19.40">And he said, well, why isn't that my phone number? And I said, because that's my phone number. The phone number that you just made up is actually my phone number.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:07:33.64"> These stories reminded me of an old Chinese saying I once heard. Actually, I learned it a couple weeks ago. And I have no idea how old it is, but it goes like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:07:41.82"> [SPEAKING MANDARIN].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:07:43.42"> That's my friend Yuen Yuen Di.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:07:45.13"> [SPEAKING MANDARIN].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:07:47.26"> And what does it mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:07:49.62"> If there's no coincidence, there won't be stories.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:07:52.77"> No coincidence, no story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:07:55.10"> To imply that, of course, lives are all, I don't know, developed in the ways that we can predict.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:08:04.22">So is it like, if you heard a story with a coincidence, afterwards you might be like, no coincidence, no story, like that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:08:10.01"> That's right, yes. Just expression you use that you quote.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:08:13.85">Is it like a corny thing to say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:08:15.72"> Mostly I think no, it won't be a corny thing to say.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:08:19.19">Do you ever use it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:08:22.23"> When I'm corny, yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:08:27.31"> At the risk of being corny, I'm going to say it. Today's show-- no coincidence, no story. While the big man's away-- Ira's on vacation-- we're going to sneak these coincidence stories onto the air. All the stories you'll hear today, they are verified true stories that my colleagues hid from me until the actual interviews so it wouldn't spoil the surprise, which is why there is so much unprofessional giggling this hour.</p><p begin="00:08:50.00">And full disclosure-- I came into this topic a coincidence skeptic. Or rather, believing that a coincidence is just a coincidence, nothing more. I judged. I confronted weakness. I countered wide-eyed faith with statistical probability. And by the end-- well, stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:11.97">Act One, Grandmas.</p><p begin="00:09:14.55">Blake Oliver is living in Nicaragua right now. We talked on Skype. About four months ago, he was on the phone to his friend Camille, who goes by Cami. He mentioned to her that the screensaver on his iPhone had been the same picture for a long time, that he wanted to change it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:09:27.80">So I asked her to just send me a picture of something. And it was really funny. She ended up sending me this picture of her as little kid as a joke. And I was like, oh, yeah, that's kind of funny. It's not what I was expecting, but that's funny. And then I glanced back at the picture, and I saw my grandma walking through behind her.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:51.21">What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:09:52.44"> Yeah. How crazy is that, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:55.04"> Very crazy. The picture was taken about 18 years ago.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:09:59.64"> But you recognized her right away?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:10:01.73"> Oh, absolutely. There's no question that was Grandma Joyce. It was without question Grandma Joyce.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:07.18"> Coincidences like this one usually have a dense nest of details to bolster their craziness. Here goes. Blake is from Michigan. That's where he met Camille. But Camille's family isn't from Michigan at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:10:18.50">They're originally from Salt Lake City, Utah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:21.83"> That's where she grew up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:10:23.15"> Yeah, that's where she grew up.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:25.00"> Was this photo from Utah?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:10:27.53"> No. And that's the funny thing, is my grandma lives in Melbourne, Florida. And I'm thinking, oh, she must have been in Utah and walked past it. And Cami's like, no, that picture was taken in Parksville, Vancouver Island, in Canada.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:41.63"> What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:10:43.12"> Yeah, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:10:52.19"> Blake figured out that at the same time that Cami and her family were on vacation in Vancouver, Grandma Joyce had gone there to visit some of her husband's relatives.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:11:00.26"> Like, what are the chances to think that not only did I meet Cami, but she sends me this picture of her in the background, of my grandma?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:11:10.57">I don't know what the chances are. Minuscule!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:11:13.64">It's insane. Right?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:11:15.24">Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:11:15.63">It's crazy. I don't know if you've seen the picture, but not only just in the picture, but perfectly behind her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:11:25.13"> At that moment, a fellow producer emailed me the photo. And there it was, cute four-year-old Cami in the foreground, facing the camera, and not far behind her, a blonde woman walking past wearing blue shorts and a matching top.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:11:37.53"> Yeah, and she has no idea she's in the picture even.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:11:40.42"> Yeah, right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:11:41.29"> No clue.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:11:41.92">She doesn't seem aware. But I have to say, it's not a very crisp photo. I'm sort of surprised you would recognize her right away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Blake Oliver</h4><p begin="00:11:50.96"> Well, yeah, there's not a lot of-- it's my grandma. I don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:12:07.49"> 20 years ago, for my first reporting job, I interviewed a woman who'd just turned 100 years old. I asked her, admittedly, a rookie question. What's the most amazing thing that's happened in your life?</p><p begin="00:12:18.02">And she thought for a while. And then she said, the most interesting thing that happened to me was that on my first day at [? Patrog ?] School, the principal said to me, what's your name? I said Esther Tuttle. And he said, I have friend in Shelter Island by that name. I was 12, she said, and that to me was remarkable.</p><p begin="00:12:38.28">This woman had seen the advent of cars, and movies, and computers, and space travel, and this was her answer. At the time, I thought it was lame, that maybe Esther was losing it a little. But since I started hearing all these coincidence stories the last couple of weeks, I've reconsidered.</p><p begin="00:12:54.57">Coincidences feel so rare, they stick with you even when the coincidence is barely a coincidence at all. An academic study of people's reactions to coincidence stories from the early 1980s found that we have an egocentric bias toward our own coincidences, that people find stories that happened to them far more surprising than the same stories happening to other people. Case in point.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Juliana Bontrager</h4><p begin="00:13:17.09"> My name is Juliana Bontrager and I'm 16 years old.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:13:20.16"> Juliana, she's got a problem with her grandmother.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Juliana Bontrager</h4><p begin="00:13:23.01"> My grandma has been obsessed with coincidences. And she finds them in her life all the time. And she always want to tell everyone about them. And we get kind of annoyed with her sometimes, because she thinks they're so incredible, and how they happen to her all the time. It's every time we see her-- oh my gosh, you would not believe what happened to me.</p><p begin="00:13:46.46">And [INAUDIBLE] I was at the hospital. She lives with her cousin. So she takes her cousin to the doctor's office quite a bit for appointments and stuff. And she'll be sitting in the waiting room, and then they'll drive to go get lunch after that. And they'll see the people they were waiting in the waiting room with at the restaurant.</p><p begin="00:14:08.56">And I always thought that was funny, because it's like, yeah, that's a coincidence. But maybe they're just trying to get lunch, too. Like, it's not that big of a deal.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:14:16.45"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Juliana Bontrager</h4><p begin="00:14:17.25">So then a while ago, I was doing a project in my English class. We were reading <i>The</i> <i>Scarlet</i> <i>Letter</i> book. And once we finished the book, our end-project was we had to come up with what our sin was, or what sin we struggled with the most. And I chose envy. So we had to create our own letter out of paper. And then we had to safety-pin it to our shirt and wear it around the school the entire day.</p><p begin="00:14:45.16">So as I was coloring in my letter and cutting it out, my mom was listening to the show <i>Monk</i> in the background. As we were watching it, I was literally cutting out my last line on the letter "E" for envy. And it said on the show, I've studied the seven sins, and the most prominent one is envy-- as I was cutting out my letter.</p><p begin="00:15:12.86">And so I immediately called my grandma and was telling her about it. And she was like, oh, uh-huh, that's a good one, yeah. And then I didn't really hear back from her after that. And I thought, well, maybe she's just envious of my great coincidence.</p><p begin="00:15:28.29">And I was sitting there like, are you kidding? Mine was so much better! You just happened to run into a person twice in one day. I do that all the time. What are the odds of, as I'm cutting out this letter "E", they would talk about that on the show? And I was so confused about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:15:45.95"> OK, so Juliana's coincidence is a common one. We've all had those moments when you're reading a certain word and then someone says it on the radio or on TV. But remember, Juliana's 16, so maybe this is the first time it's happening to her. Still, I'm on her side here. I think it is more remarkable than her grandmother's example of the people in the waiting room being at the restaurant.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:16:04.71"> Do you have a phone where you can dial up your grandma right now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Juliana Bontrager</h4><p begin="00:16:09.05">I can try.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:16:09.94"> Try it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Juliana Bontrager</h4><p begin="00:16:11.24"> OK, one second.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:16:13.00"> So Juliana conferenced her grandmother in so we could settle this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:16:16.18"> I'm here. Elaine Olson.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:16:18.68"> Elaine Olson, nice to meet you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:16:21.39"> Nice to meet you, dear.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:16:23.46"> I laid out my argument for Elaine about the purity, and therefore superiority, of Juliana's example. But Elaine argued right back. There were several hours between the two sightings. Plus, the restaurant was about four miles from the hospital.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:16:36.24"> And in that four-mile radius, you might say, I could have gone to any number of restaurants. The fact that I ran into her at that restaurant, I think, is a coincidence. She could have gone any place, too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:16:50.29"> That's true. I mean, that's true. I'm not saying it's not a coincidence. I'm just saying it's not maybe as pure. Like, you can break down the probabilities of a certain kind of person in a certain kind of neighborhood.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:17:02.87">I don't think so.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:17:03.56">You don't think so?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:17:04.96">I don't think so.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:17:07.07"> Do you think you're somehow prone to coincidences? Like, coincidences find you more than they find other people?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:17:13.34"> I don't know. That's why, in my own family, I've asked them does this happen to you, and don't get much of a response.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Juliana Bontrager</h4><p begin="00:17:23.37"> You are very impossible to argue with. So when you ask for coincidences, we have nothing to give to you, because you are so set in your ways.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:17:34.26">I'm 81, OK, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:17:36.66"> So what would Juliana have to experience in terms of a coincidence that would impress you, do you think? Like, what would it need to be?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elaine Olson</h4><p begin="00:17:46.86"> Well, you know, it's hard to tell. Just a couple of weeks ago, I had my cousin up at another doctor's. And I'm sitting in the reception area. The gentleman across--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:17:58.45"> This time it was about an Asian man in the waiting room whom she later saw buying a melon at Trader Joe's, which Elaine admitted wasn't as good as the other one.</p></div>  </div>

    <div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:18:14.12">Act Two, In God We Trust.</p><p begin="00:18:16.24">It's probably no surprise that we got a huge number of coincidence pitches about love-- romantic love. A few years ago, after Stephen Lee proposed to his girlfriend Helen, they brought their families together for the first time to celebrate the engagement.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephen Lee</h4><p begin="00:18:29.13"> My mom and my stepdad came to New York to meet with Helen's parents. And basically over the course of dinner and coffee afterwards, we discovered that, basically, my father had dated my wife's mother back in Korea back in the 1960s. And he had proposed to her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:18:52.92"> I'm going to slow this down a sec just to let it sink in. Helen's mother had almost married Stephen's father-- his late father, actually. He died when Stephen was 17. And how this all came out was that after they had dinner, they went back to Stephen's apartment. And they were looking at Stephen's family photographs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephen Lee</h4><p begin="00:19:09.34"> So my future mother-in-law's flipping through the album and she sees my dad. And so she asks, oh, what was his name? And my mom tells the name. And my future mother-in-law kind of just nods and just moves on, keeps on flipping through the book, doesn't even say anything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:19:28.39"> Imagine what she must have been feeling with seeing that photo suddenly, just flooded. Crazy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephen Lee</h4><p begin="00:19:36.31"> I think she'd be really good at poker.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:19:38.80"> Right.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:19:41.30"> So Helen's mother says nothing, goes home. But later that night she tells her daughter, this was the one. This was the man who might have been.</p><p begin="00:19:50.55">She explained that the reason they hadn't married was because her father, Helen's grandfather, had chosen a different husband for her-- the man who became Helen's father. All of them ended up living in the US, but they quickly lost touch. And Stephen didn't find out about any of this until a couple of days later.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephen Lee</h4><p begin="00:20:06.32"> That's when Helen calls me up and says, I have something to tell you. And she tells me, and I was floored by it. And together we called my mom. And she put a good face on it, but she was pretty shocked.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:20:24.53"> Did she know that there had been this other woman that your father had been in love with?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephen Lee</h4><p begin="00:20:28.54">That's the thing. My dad told her years and years ago, there was this other woman that I was in love with at one point, long before I met you. My  mom was like, look, you have a past, I have a past, we all have a past, who cares? Of course, never thinking that she was going to share grandchildren with that woman. I  mean, she later admitted to me that if she had known this from the very beginning, she would have not supported Helen and me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:20:55.33"> Really?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephen Lee</h4><p begin="00:20:56.28"> It would have just been like, look, being with the daughter of the other woman your dad loved, I mean, can't you find someone else?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:21:09.35"> How did you take this coincidence? Did it come to mean anything to you or to Helen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Stephen Lee</h4><p begin="00:21:17.09"> Yeah, there's something about it-- the fact that I didn't have the time with my dad that I wished I had, and then suddenly to kind of have him be an active part of my life again. To think that I can talk to my mother-in-law and hear what he was like in his 20s, something that my mom doesn't even know.</p><p begin="00:21:37.99">And, actually, Helen's father is a strong believer in the idea that somehow my dad is behind all this, that somehow he kind of helped make all this happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:21:55.94"> At the time this next love story takes place, a guy named Paul Grachan was working in a Chicago suburb called Arlington Heights. He'd just started dating a woman named Esther. They'd been out maybe eight times.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Grachan</h4><p begin="00:22:07.27"> And I thought maybe it was time to get exclusive, or become boyfriend/girlfriend, or whatever it was. And I was about to go out to lunch, and I was thinking about asking her on a Friday date that I had set up. And I went out to lunch.</p><p begin="00:22:21.84">I stopped at the store prior to hitting the deli that I normally hit. And I got some change, went to the deli, ordered my sandwich. It was six bucks, or something like that.</p><p begin="00:22:30.96">I pulled out a five from my wallet, and I pulled out the couple bucks change that I'd gotten from the store, handed the clerk one of the ones. And then I looked at it and I pulled it back. Written on the dollar in pencil was "Esther."</p><p begin="00:22:46.69">And I thought oh, that's weird. I'm thinking about asking her to go steady and I get this dollar that says Esther on it. That's bizarre. So I stuck it in my pocket, chuckled.</p><p begin="00:22:55.84">I went to the store. I got one of those floating frames and a little piece of gold lame, and I stuck the dollar in the frame. So it was floating in the middle on this piece of gold, as if you're going to go in a church in Italy and they had a fragment from the robe of some saint or something like that. And I called it the "Immaculate Dollar of Arlington Heights."</p><p begin="00:23:18.66">So on the Friday, I asked her out. And she was all excited, and we were all giddy. And then I said, hey, I have one more thing for you. And  I gave her this frame with this dollar in it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:23:29.17"> I start unwrapping it. And he's like, it's a dollar with your name on it. And he's all beside himself. And I just looked at him like I'm freaked out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Grachan</h4><p begin="00:23:41.02"> She kind of furrowed her brow a little bit and looked concerned. And I said, is there some sort of problem?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:23:49.90"> I was speechless for the first time ever. But I said, remind me to tell you something later.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Grachan</h4><p begin="00:24:01.16"> So, OK, I let it go. And we had a relationship, got engaged. We got married. A couple years later, we were unpacking at a new apartment that we had. And I found the frame with the dollar in it, and I stuck it up on the dresser.</p><p begin="00:24:17.11">And she came in the room. I said, hey, you never told me about this dollar. What's the deal with that? She said, well--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:24:22.90"> When I was 19, I was a cashier working in a copy shop in downtown Chicago. And I was dating someone, and I just wasn't happy with him. And I just thought, how do people know who's the right person that they're meant to be with? How do they know who that is?</p><p begin="00:24:41.45">I said, you know what, I'm not going to worry about that. I'm just going to put my name on this dollar bill. And the guy that gets this dollar bill is going to be the guy that asks me to marry him. And I'm like, well, you can't just write your name on one. Actually, I think it was more like maybe 10 or 12.</p><p begin="00:24:59.40">And so this dollar bill that you gave me, I believe, is the same dollar bill that I wrote my name on. And I knew that we were going to be married the day that you gave me this dollar bill.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Grachan</h4><p begin="00:25:10.66"> It was pretty crazy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:25:11.95"> And then he made me tell him the story again. He asked me, like, five or six times. And I said, the details don't change. It's the same story. I think he was a little bit beside himself that that actually happened and that I didn't tell him.</p><p begin="00:25:29.66">I don't know how I found the will to not say anything to him. But I just remember, do I? Don't I? Do I? Don't I? What do I do?</p><p begin="00:25:38.57">I don't want to freak this guy out and be like, what? This girl's already talking about marriage? Wait, what? Forget it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Grachan</h4><p begin="00:25:45.97"> I don't read too much into almost anything. So I just kind of move forward. And then after she told me, I think I went through all the normal stages of whatever.</p><p begin="00:25:55.54">And I just thought, what does this mean for us? Are we going to invent a time machine? Or are our kids going to bring world peace? Like, what's the point? Because there's some sort of bigger thing that we're not seeing here.</p><p begin="00:26:11.18">Now it just sits in that very same frame up on our dresser. And I look at it every day that I wake up. Sometimes I remind her that we have it when she's upset at me or angry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Esther Grachan</h4><p begin="00:26:24.35"> It's never been a question in my mind-- like, you know what, I'm going to kick this guy to the curb. But I do believe it's because of this dollar that I feel tied to him.</p><p begin="00:26:33.10">I mean, obviously I love him. But I think that if it ever did cross my mind, I'd be like, but wait, this is my soul mate. I can't just walk out on him. We don't even wear wedding bands. I'm like, why? It's just, I know I'm stuck with you. We got this dollar bill.</p><p begin="00:26:52.27">I guess he could also put it back out into the register and then be like, look, I'm cashing this in. I think it's gotta go to somebody else. He could do that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:27:04.84"> Paul and Esther Grachan, they've been married for 14 years.</p><p begin="00:27:08.35">[MUSIC - "SOMEPLACE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE" BY BRY WEBB WITH RICH BURNETT]</p></div>  </div>

  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:27:51.64">Act Three, Brother Can You Spare a Dime?</p><p begin="00:27:55.06">This story comes from Ryan Rozar in Los Angeles.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:27:58.01"> It happened when I was in college. I was actually pledging a fraternity. And I ran into some of the seniors on campus, and they were laughing about something.</p><p begin="00:28:10.54">And so one of them tells me this story that had happened to them that day, supposedly, where he gets in the shower, and about 5, 10 minutes into his shower, he hears a "ting." And he looks down, and sitting on the floor of the shower between his feet is a nickel, and has no idea where this nickel came from or why it's there.</p><p begin="00:28:37.51">Obviously, everyone was making jokes that he had change falling out of his butt. And people were like, were you eating dollar bills? But anyway, we have our laughs. And I go home and I don't think much about it.</p><p begin="00:28:53.48">The next day I get in the shower. And like 5, 10 minutes into my shower, I hear "ting." And I looked down, and right between my feet is a quarter.</p><p begin="00:29:08.04">So my first thought was, how did they do it? I totally assumed that this must not have really happened to him. That was a set-up, and somehow they set this up to happen to me. But I could not figure out how. It had to be a prank, basically.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:29:26.61"> That's so smart of you to figure out the whole con.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:29:32.19"> I mean, that's what I assumed. But then I go and I talk to him, and I tell him what happened to me. And I'm kind of watching his face for the laugh or the glint in his eye of mischief, or whatever. And he just looks sincerely mystified by the fact that this happened to me right after it happened to him.</p><p begin="00:29:52.72">Then, like, a week later, I get in the shower. And 5, 10 minutes in, I hear "ting," "ting." And I look down, and there's about $0.35 between my feet. So there's that moment of "no way" before I look down and there's more change.</p><p begin="00:30:16.84">So at this point, obviously, my mind's going to some weird places, because you don't want to be the butt change fairy guy. There's no way this story gets good for me.</p><p begin="00:30:32.80">And then no explanation comes, but it doesn't happen for a while-- for, like, I want to say probably a month. Until one day I'm about to get in the shower, and I reach behind me to scratch my back and I feel something cold and metal on my back. And I turn around to turn my back to the mirror, and there is a whole pocketful of change stuck to my back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:31:01.12"> What do you mean stuck to it? In what way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:31:04.36"> Well, this is what I figured out. There was no adhesive or anything. It was just impressed into my back. So I figured out what was going on, is that I had a bad habit of falling asleep with my pants on, because it was college-- I'd nap a lot. And so I would also asleep with my shirt off, because my apartment was really hot.</p><p begin="00:31:27.73">So what was happening was change was falling out of my pockets onto my bed, and I was laying on it. And all that sweat and pressure was just sticking the coins to my back. Like, they're just literally impressed into my back. And it was taking about five minutes of water running on it to dislodge them, at which point they're dropping at my feet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:31:59.10"> Clearly, I love this story. But I did not see the coincidence in it. Ryan said there was absolutely a coincidence. It happened to that one kid, the senior, and then it happened to him the very next day.</p><p begin="00:32:10.80">I disagree. I think this is probably a common quirk of college-boy life. Lounging around, shirtless and groggy on unclean sofas and beds, probably half the boys at his college had change stuck to them. I told Ryan so.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:32:22.84"> I don't think there's any coincidence involved at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ryan Rozar</h4><p begin="00:32:26.20"> I do, because, I'll tell you, I've known lots of guys who've lived in pretty squalor conditions, and other than me and that other guy, I've never heard someone having the change falling from them in the middle of a shower.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:32:44.18">It's just because they're not admitting it. I swear to God. Start asking.</p><p begin="00:32:51.41">[KNOCK ON DOOR]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:32:53.68"> Hello.

    <div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:36:30.12"> My name's Jeff Dunn.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:36:31.24"> Jeff Dunn, OK.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:36:32.67"> Jeff grew up in Sioux City, Iowa. When he was 16, he was hanging out with two  of his friends at someone's house. The parents weren't home. They were goofing around, smoking pot. They were in the living room that had a huge window on one wall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:36:44.86"> And so we're kind of sitting along this glass wall. And there's a dirt road outside of his house. And up this dirt road barrels this van.</p><p begin="00:36:55.92">And the thing that happens next is what you think is going to happen when you see a white van like that at night. These two guys get out. They're all kind of bundled up. And they pretty quickly just run to the back of the van, open it up, and pull out this big, black bag.</p><p begin="00:37:13.96">So they get out. They take the bag out. And they quickly run up this small hill that's behind his house. And it's all wooded. There's no houses back there.</p><p begin="00:37:23.81">So they run up this hill with this bag. And less than two minutes later, they come running back down. And they get in the van and they take off.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:37:34.61"> So Jeff and his friends do precisely what you don't want them to do. If this were an after-school special, this is the point where you're yelling at the TV saying, don't do it! Stay inside! But they decide they have to find out what the strange men in the van have deposited at the top of the hill, so they run up there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:37:50.97"> We get to the top, and we kind of look around. And then we see that on one side of it, there's this manhole cover, like a circular manhole cover like you'd see anywhere. And coming from one of the edges of the manhole cover-- it's in place-- is long, brown human hair.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:38:11.35"> Long, brown human hair. They are teenagers. They are stoned. They are freaked out. They have to tell an adult about what they've seen. A police car happens to drive by. They flag it down and the officer tells them to get in the back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:38:25.35"> It became clear that she was really concerned, because she then said, yeah, there's been a girl missing on the west side of town for the last couple days.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:38:34.40">Oh my God.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:38:35.23"> So again, our hearts just sort of dropped.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:38:38.07"> And you hadn't known? That hadn't been on the news or something like that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:38:40.68">We had no idea.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:38:41.27">You had no idea, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:38:43.31">So we just kind of got scared at that point.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:38:45.62">Can I stop you for a second? Is this story going to get funny, or is this a horrifying story? Wait, actually, don't tell me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:38:50.86">I can't tell you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:38:51.66">OK, don't tell me</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:38:53.51"> So she calls another officer, and the other officer comes. There's a couple cars. And they both get out, and they tell us to get out. And they say, OK, wait at the bottom of the hill.</p><p begin="00:39:05.09">So we're waiting. They go walking up to the top. And it's dark, so we can't really see them that well, but we can see them well enough.</p><p begin="00:39:15.11">And we don't really want to watch what's going on, because we see them bend over, pull the cover off. And I'm trying not to look, but of course I'm looking. And she pulls up a human figure out of the hole.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:39:30.84">Oh, my God.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:39:31.80"> And then she says, it's a mannequin. I don't know what my friends were thinking. But I was sitting there thinking, how does this story end up OK? And it doesn't in any universe, unless you say it's a mannequin.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:40:01.96"> Jeff goes to school on Monday, tells his story in physics class. And the kid next to him says, that was us. We did it. We went around stealing holiday decorations. And we had to get rid of them, so we stuffed them under the manhole cover. The mannequin, by the way, had been the Virgin Mary in someone's nativity scene.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:40:17.89"> I think the real coincidence is that it's our close friends that caused this to happen to us.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:40:25.39">Oh, they were good friends of yours?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:40:26.75">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:40:27.24"> Right.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:40:29.93"> No, Jeff. Turns out, that is not the real coincidence of the story. My fellow producer Brian Reed was listening to all these interviews as they were happening. And he interrupted to tell us we both missed the point.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:40:40.78"> Brian's just pointed out that you and I are both missing the big coincidence.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:40:44.61">I don't even know the coincidence of my own story. Yeah, I submitted it to the coincidences thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:40:48.99"> So the main coincidence is there's a girl missing at the same time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jeff Dunn</h4><p begin="00:40:52.41"> Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:40:58.23"> I have five words for you, Jeff.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yuen Yuen Di</h4><p begin="00:41:00.60">[SPEAKING MANDARIN]</p><p begin="00:41:01.66"/></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:41:02.90">No coincidence, no story.</p><p begin="00:41:06.12">Here's a definition of coincidence that seems right to me. A coincidence is a surprising concurrence of events, perceived as meaningfully related, with no apparent causal connection. It's that middle part, "meaningfully related," that people seem to get stuck on, because when events line up just so, you can't help it. You can't help but wonder if there's a message in that.</p><p begin="00:41:27.45">In that way, coincidences are kind of like shortcuts to very big questions about fate, about God, even to people who don't believe in either one. The notion that somewhere out there, someone or something is paying attention to your life, that there might be a plan conjured through coincidences, that notion seems to be most appealing when you're young.</p><p begin="00:41:48.23">We got one story about a young couple visiting Marrakesh in Morocco. They're at a restaurant, talking like you do about old flames. The boyfriend wanted to know about one guy in particular.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Erik Johnson</h4><p begin="00:41:57.52"> I asked Kate, Kate, what did this guy look like? And Kate just stopped dead in her tracks and lifted one hand to her mouth, and with the other hand pointed across the restaurant. And she said, oh my God, he looked like that. And she crossed the restaurant and tapped him on the back of the shoulder, and it was him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:42:17.46"> The daughter of a jazz guitarist named Andy Riley wrote to us about the time she was 19, in a room listening to an Ella Fitzgerald album.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Leila Wright</h4><p begin="00:42:24.72"> I was listening to the song "That Old Black Magic." And at the end of the song, Ella throws in a line, "that old black magic that Billy Daniels got me in." And I've heard her sing that line on that album dozens of times before and wondered, who's Billy Daniels?</p><p begin="00:42:41.12">But on this particular day, for some reason, I felt inspired to go out to the living room and ask my dad who Billy Daniels was. And he explained that in the '40s, Billy Daniels had sung "Old Black Magic" in a way that made it his song. And he was referred to as Mr. Black Magic, I guess, back in the '40s. And it was a big deal at the time.</p><p begin="00:43:00.73">And I asked my dad, had you met him? Did you ever know Billy Daniels? And he said that Billy Daniels is probably dead now.</p><p begin="00:43:08.42">And just literally at that moment, the phone rang. So I answer the phone, and this playful, gravelly voice asked for Andy Riley. And I said, who's calling? And he said, Billy Daniels.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:43:32.20"> So last September, I was living in Roswell, New Mexico. And I had woken up in jail for the last time.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:43:41.21"> This is Etta Thordarson. When this happened, just six months ago, she was 20 years old, on drugs, hanging out with street kids. Her mom offered to buy her a bus ticket to Washington state to go to rehab. Etta said yes. She took her dog and got on the bus.</p><p begin="00:43:56.40">In Los Angeles, there was a stopover at the depot. And this guy comes up to her while she's waiting in line to get food. She's got $2, just enough for some French fries. The guy starts asking her questions about her dog.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:44:06.87"> And he starts asking me other random questions like, what are you doing? Where are you going? And then he asked me, are you from Alaska? And I was like, uh, yeah, I am, actually. And then he asked me, is your mom named Meg? And I was like, yeah, she is.</p><p begin="00:44:26.29">And he's like, oh, well, I'm Chris. I'm your father. I met you 10 years ago. And I was like oh, holy [BLEEP].</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:44:33.54"> Etta had only seen her father that one time, briefly, when she was 11.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:44:37.54"> And then he pulls out a big wad of money and he pays for my food. And then he hands me $40 and is like, don't say I never gave you nothing, and walked away.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:44:54.04"> I'm shocked by this story. And that was it? You didn't see him again? He didn't--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:44:59.23"> No. You could tell he felt bad.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:45:07.96"> Did you expect something more to happen? Did you think, oh, well, here's how this is gonna go?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:45:12.41">Yeah, I really thought we were going to sit down and eat together and I was going to lay out my whole life story for him. And he was going to explain his life and where he's been. I was kind of looking forward to that, but then it didn't happen.</p><p begin="00:45:29.16">Mostly I just wanted to study his face for longer, just because, I mean, I've seen him twice, and I still can't really remember what he looks like.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:45:40.15"> Do you regret not pursuing him in some way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Etta Thordarson</h4><p begin="00:45:44.88"> Yeah, absolutely. In the moment, I was just so sick. I just really couldn't comprehend. It wasn't until I got on the bus that I was kind of just like, why didn't I run after him?</p><p begin="00:45:59.48">I've just spent my whole life wondering about this man. And the chance to talk to him was put right in front of my face. And I didn't really understand that at the time and I let it go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:16.88"> Emiliano Garcia-Sarnoff also hadn't seen his father in many years, since he was seven or eight years old. He lived in California, but was visiting a national park in Mexico with his mother when he was 18. They hiked to the top of a pyramid there. The whole place was sort of off the beaten track.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Emiliano Garcia-sarnoff</h4><p begin="00:46:33.13"> We were walking along, and some people passed in front of us. And my mom said, oh my God, Raoul? And then she turned to me and said, that's your father. That's your dad. And it was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:46:52.24"> Also, coincidentally, it was Father's Day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Emiliano Garcia-sarnoff</h4><p begin="00:46:54.78"> So I ended up embarrassingly breaking down and crying on that pyramid. It was a really emotional moment for me. My father, definitely his absence meant a lot to me.</p><p begin="00:47:05.19">Then we said, yeah, we're going to stay in contact. And after they said bye, they left. And he came running back up the hill about 20 minutes later. And you could hear him panting. And he said, Emiliano, I just want to say I'm sorry that I didn't stay in touch, and that I love you. And he turned and went back down the hill.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:47:25.62"> Emiliano's story goes the way Etta wishes hers had gone. After a rocky few years, he and his father did get to know each other and each other's families. Emiliano had a son who now had a grandfather.</p><p begin="00:47:37.87">Emiliano's father had left him when he was a baby. But when his father died a couple of years ago, Emiliano was there at the hospital. They'd had a real relationship. And that never would have happened, Emiliano said, if he hadn't seen him that day at the pyramid.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Emiliano Garcia-sarnoff</h4><p begin="00:47:50.63"> Walking down that pyramid, I was talking out loud to myself. And this is one strong memory I have, is I was saying, don't forget, don't forget, and just sort of getting angry with my future self, which I knew would rationalize this event. Because I had the very distinct sense that I had felt that this was definitely a miracle.</p><p begin="00:48:12.57">Something had intervened and brought us together. You don't just run into your father on top of a pyramid. So I think I was a believer for about a week. And then--</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Five. What Are The Chances?</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:48:25.09"> And then, that very pause, that brings us to Act Five, What Are The Chances? In order to let a good coincidence live a long and healthy life, to get told and retold and take its rightful place in the narrative of your life, sometimes you have to stop yourself from thinking it all the way through, why it happened, really, because the fact is, any statistician will probably rain on your parade, will tell you these things happen a lot more often than you think.</p><p begin="00:48:52.49">But a good coincidence is like a good magic trick. When you see one, a struggle ensues instantaneously between the thrill of the apparent miracle and the urge to debunk it. This final story is by Kerry Weeks. He's a prop guy for the movies, but he told this at a storytelling competition.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kerry Weeks</h4><p begin="00:49:08.86"> So here's my story. Nine years old, first time going to summer camp. And my grandfather gives me, before I go, his old pocket knife. It's practically an antique.</p><p begin="00:49:20.71">And so the first thing all of us boys do when we get to camp is we pull out our knives and we start throwing them at things, trying to get them to stick the way Daniel Boone did. And because this is the 1970s, there's nothing unusual about a bunch of young children throwing sharp knives around.</p><p begin="00:49:38.60">And I got mine to stick in the floorboard. It was like, "wong." And it was great, but when I pulled it out the tip broke off. But anyway, camp goes on. And a few days later, I notice my knife is missing. And I look everywhere for it. I look high, I look low. It's gone.</p><p begin="00:49:56.71">But then one day, I'm waking through camp, and I see this group of boys throwing knives at a tree. And something tells me I should check this out. And sure enough, there's this boy there throwing my knife.</p><p begin="00:50:09.46">Now, there's no mistaking this knife, because the handle was red and green, but the colors met in the middle and kind of swirled together in a trippy, psychedelic way. And I've never seen a knife like that before or since.</p><p begin="00:50:23.71">So I walk up to this boy. He's a little older, but I walk up to him and I say, hey, that's my knife. And he says, no, it's mine. And I say, no, that's my knife. My grandfather gave it to me. And he says, no, he didn't. He says, my grandfather gave it to me.</p><p begin="00:50:44.56">And I'm confused all of a sudden. Maybe I should have thought this through a bit more. I thought he would just hand it over.</p><p begin="00:50:53.51">And the other boys, they move in close. And I'm thinking, could it be possible that his grandfather gave him the exact same knife that my grandfather gave me? I mean, is this a thing and I just didn't know it?</p><p begin="00:51:10.02">But I look at the knife he's holding in his hand, and I look at the blade. And I see that the tip of the blade is squared off as though it were broken. And I say, that's my knife, because I broke the tip off when I stuck it in the floor. And says what, that? No! It came that way so you can use it like a screwdriver.</p><p begin="00:51:36.65">And I look at the other boys. And I'm not getting any help from them. And so I wander off just thinking to myself, screwdriver-- I never thought of that.</p><p begin="00:51:50.68">Well, as you can imagine, this really bugged me. And I don't mean just while I was at camp, but, like, for the rest of my life. And I kept thinking, why did I fold so easily? Why didn't I go to the counselors?</p><p begin="00:52:08.61">And the only thing I can think of is this-- I'm the son of a physicist. And I used to ask my dad these questions all the time. Like, dad, how far away is the sun? Dad, how fast is the speed of light? Dad, what's the closest star? And he would give me these answers and these numbers that were just so [BLEEP] huge, I couldn't get my mind around them.</p><p begin="00:52:32.51">So my point is this. I, better than most other children, had an idea of just how vast the universe is, and therefore how infinite the possibilities are. So the thing is, at the time I thought, well, maybe the kid's telling the truth.</p><p begin="00:52:55.98">So the only reason why I bring this up is because this is what I was thinking of when, some 32 years later, I become the landlord of a small apartment building. And one of the first things I did as a landlord was I threw this guy out because he was a small-time drug dealer.</p><p begin="00:53:12.88">And so, on the day he's moving out, I get a call from his neighbor across the hall, a guy I call Budweiser Bob. And Budweiser Bob says, hey, that druggie is stealing your refrigerator.</p><p begin="00:53:29.90">And so I hop down there. And sure enough, in the driveway is a pickup truck. And in the back of the pickup truck is a refrigerator. So I charge up the stairs and I demand to know just what the hell's going on.</p><p begin="00:53:42.29">And Nick, the druggie, calmly tells me, he says, dude, when I moved in here, that refrigerator was so gross I bought my own refrigerator and swapped it out. And I put that one in storage and now I'm just putting it back. And I look in the kitchen, and sure enough, there's another refrigerator. It's a little old, a little dirty, but it's working.</p><p begin="00:54:03.63">And I'm trying to think this through. I mean, would someone really go to all that trouble of just swapping out a refrigerator and then putting it in storage and bringing it back? Or would a guy go to the trouble of stealing a used refrigerator just to screw his landlord and replacing it with an even more used refrigerator? And, well, the answer to both these questions is yes.</p><p begin="00:54:33.79">But I look up and there's Nick, and he's expecting me to say something. And there's his buddies who are helping him move, and they're expecting me to say something. So I walk up to Nick, and I look him in the eye. And I say to him, you sweep up real good before you leave. Because there's just too many possibilities in this universe.</p><p begin="00:54:58.51">Thank you.</p><p begin="00:54:59.21">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Koenig</h4><p begin="00:55:02.31"> Kerry Weeks lives in New York.

But after talking to so many people about coincidences, including a Stanford mathematician who spent decades studying them, I end up here, agreeing with this one woman I interviewed about her coincidence.
