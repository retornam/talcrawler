  <h3>Prologue.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.65">When the phone calls started, Meron Estefanos was leading a quiet, busy life. She was a single mom with two young boys, going to school, holding down a couple jobs, including working as a freelance radio reporter. She'd been born in Eritrea in East Africa, moved to Sweden as a teenager, and she was living in a suburb of Stockholm.</p><p begin="00:00:19.06">She was also a human rights activist focusing on Eritrea. That's what her radio stories were about, too. And so she was used to people phoning her with tips and leads now and then. But at the end of February 2011 came this phone call.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:00:31.65">This guy from UK called me and told me that his brother was kidnapped and that he was being asked $20,000 for the release of his brother.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.08">The man said his brother was with other people who had been kidnapped, all of them Eritrean, and that they were in the desert, far from Eritrea. They were on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, close to the border with Israel. He said they were being tortured and held for ransom. $20,000 each, which seemed absurdly high to Meron. Eritrea is a country where the average person makes less than $1,000 a year.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:01:03.58">I had a hard time believing that, actually, what he was telling me was true. And he understood that people were hard time believing, so he said, well, if you don't believe me, here. So he gave me two phone numbers. He said, you can talk to the hostages yourself.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:18.58">Meron wanted it to be a lie, and she couldn't bring herself to try the numbers. But then that night, she couldn't sleep thinking about it, so--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:28.73"> [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:01:30.26">Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:31.57"> Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:01:32.91">Hello, salam, Meron Estefanos. [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:36.12">Meron called the numbers. And remember, she was a radio reporter. She did reporting for two radio stations that broadcast by shortwave and satellite into Eritrea and over the internet to Eritrean emigres around the world. So she recorded these phone calls, hoping she could do a story.</p><p begin="00:01:49.70">Here's one of the first calls she made. And yes, someone did pick up. And yes, he said he was being held hostage. He told her his name was Biniam, he was 22 years old, that he'd fled Eritrea in 2010. Had been living in a refugee camp in Sudan, working at a farm, when he was kidnapped and taken to Sinai.</p><p begin="00:02:07.07">He said he was there with other people in a group of 28. There had been 29, he said, but one had died. They were being held by some Bedouins, Biniam said.</p><p begin="00:02:15.79">Meron came to learn that the hostages were allowed access to cell phones so they could beg their families to send money. We have an interpreters translating what Biniam and Meron said to each other.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Binyam</h4><p begin="00:02:25.77">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:02:28.08">The place we are held at is an underground facility. They have us chained. And they have taken three people to the outside. We hear cries from the outside. We don't know whether they are being tortured or whether they are dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:02:40.49">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:02:45.37">Tell me more. What are they saying to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:02:47.85">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:02:49.46">The people who are holding us are saying that unless we make good on our investment, there will not be a solution. They tell us they will drink our blood.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:04.69">Meron had heard stories of Eritreans being kidnapped and held hostage in the Sinai before this call. People had been fleeing Eritrea for years. Its government is one of the most repressive in the world. And sometimes people got kidnapped, either on the way out on the road or from refugee camps right across the border.</p><p begin="00:03:20.48">But it was still this shadowy thing that human rights groups were just starting to report on at that point in 2011. It wasn't clear how many people it was happening to. And the ransom surprised her-- like I said, the size of it, $20,000. Meron had never heard of a ransom that high. It didn't seem like it could be real.</p><p begin="00:03:36.19">And come on. "We'll drink your blood." Really? It could even be some kind of hoax, a scam where they trump up how desperate they were to get money sent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:03:45.90">I kept telling myself, OK, maybe they are lying. It's just too hard to believe that this many people can get kidnapped and tortured and a lot of money-- it's just hard. But at the same time, I kept saying to myself, what if it's true, and I did not believe them? Then I'll regret it for the rest of my life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:14.59">So Meron calls back, and thanks to caller ID, they call her back. And then, reluctantly, she gets pulled in deeper and deeper into this situation where it is not clear exactly what is true and what isn't, and there are people who are saying their lives are in imminent danger, and it's happening thousands of miles away. But it is also happening right there in her own home, over the telephone. Imagine for a second if hostages started phoning you at your house, while you're at the dinner table, while you're sleeping.</p><p begin="00:04:45.07">Well, from WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life,</i> distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. As you'll hear, Meron ends up making lots of recordings over the phone and gets more and more involved with these people who are claiming to be hostages. And reporter Yowei Shaw, one of our producers, Brian Reed, and an Eritrean journalist, [? Belthan ?] [? Haile ?], have been going through those recordings and translating them from Tigrinya.</p><p begin="00:05:07.03">We're devoting our entire program today to Meron's story. A warning to listeners that this is a story of hostages and people having their lives threatened, and there is some content that is violent and probably not right for children to listen to. Here's reporter Yowei Shaw.</p></div>  </div>

These were not carefully crafted feature stories. She felt she didn't have time for that. They were basically raw, unedited recordings of her phone calls, with hostages describing the torture and begging for help on the air.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:11:03.28">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p><p begin="00:11:05.25"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:11:05.74"> [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:11:12.25">Meron also reached out to other reporters to try and get them to cover the story.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:11:16.35">Oh, it's very touching story, but it wouldn't sell. That's the kind of reply I would get when I called to the journalists that I knew. Sorry, we can't help you. Oh, it's not connected to Sweden, sorry. So this is the kind of reply that I was getting.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:11:29.72">Meron did manage to get a BBC reporter interested in the hostages' story, but he asked for proof. How could he verify that people were being held and tortured in Sinai? She put him in touch with a group of doctors, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, who'd been helping in interviewing Eritreans coming out of Sinai. They'd photographed people's injuries from beatings, shackles, and burns.</p><p begin="00:11:51.74">In the end, though, the BBC story didn't seem to get any attention. Meron went on a phone and email blitz, trying to publicize the issue but also hoping that something could be done for these 28 people. She contacted governments, NGOs, the United Nations Refugee Agency.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:12:08.45">There was a lot of disappointment at that time. I mean, disappointment of all institutions and disappointed at journalists, because I thought that within weeks, that I would be able to solve it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:12:22.68">Some organizations were taking small steps, like pressuring Egypt to take action. But Sinai is a lawless place. Trafficking of drugs, weapons, and people, not just Eritreans, has gone on there for years. The Bedouin tribes that live there have a contentious relationship with the Egyptian government, which has a limited military presence in Sinai because of a treaty with Israel. The police are the primary law enforcement, and they're not nearly as well-armed as Bedouin criminal networks.</p><p begin="00:12:50.68">And on top of that, early 2011 was incredibly bad timing for anyone trying to fix a problem in Sinai. The Arab Spring was going strong. Egypt was going through a revolution. Meron first got in touch with the hostages the same month that Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:13:09.34">There was no government. That was the problem. They didn't have government, so that was also one of the biggest problems that we had, because we didn't know who to talk to, because there's no government.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:13:21.96">Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:13:22.43">Hello, hello. Biniam?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:13:24.18">The hostages continued to call Meron, and the one she talked to the most was Biniam, the first guy in that phone call she recorded. He became kind of a spokesman for the group, and they developed a good rapport.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:13:34.61">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:13:36.85">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:13:40.67">Very soon, Meron was talking to Biniam nearly every day, often multiple times a day. She wanted to move on from the story, but the calls wouldn't stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:13:50.09">They saved my number, so it was really hard to even avoid it, even if I wanted to. I really wanted to avoid it. I could not just ignore those phone calls.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:14:02.72">The way it worked is the hostages would call and hang up before she answered so she could see their number and call back, since they didn't have enough phone credit. And in these conversations, Meron was always trying to figure out what was real in what the hostages were telling her. She knew that some amount of torture and killing needed to be happening to convince hostages' families to pay the insanely high ransoms.</p><p begin="00:14:25.28">But the traffickers couldn't kill too many people. It would cut into profits. So she figured they forced the hostages to exaggerate or lie sometimes. Still, she felt like she could tell real panic when she heard it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Medhane</h4><p begin="00:14:38.06">H-h-hello. H-h-hello, Meron, Meron.

She said she'd never heard anyone beg like that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Semhar</h4><p begin="00:17:58.71">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:18:04.60">And the male hostages who were in captivity with Semhar felt the same way. They told Meron that Semhar had it especially bad, even worse than them. One of the guards was taking her at night, and she came back crying. They didn't know what he was doing with her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:18:19.02">You know, they were saying, we know that you cannot save all of us. We are 28 people. But at least save this girl, and then we'll be happy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:18:29.23">Meron recorded all of these phone calls from the living room of her one-bedroom apartment, surrounded by photographs of her kids and lemon-painted walls, in the woods of a quiet suburb of Stockholm. Hostages called at all hours, during meals or in the middle of the night or early in the morning. She'd have to watch her boys while talking to the hostages. You can sometimes hear her kids in the recordings, playing nearby. And it wasn't the kind of work that ended when she hung up the phone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:18:55.56">I couldn't sleep. All I was doing is just crying. And you know, the first three weeks, I couldn't even take care of my kids, because it was just, I was almost going crazy, you know? The screams were just-- you know, I could hear the screams 24 hours in my head.</p><p begin="00:19:17.64">I couldn't breathe, you know? Like sometimes, you know, when you're tired, you say-- [EXHALES], and that feels good, like to breathe out. But for three weeks, I couldn't do that. I would be trying, and still, it doesn't come out.</p><p begin="00:19:32.11">I remember it was around 11:00 at night, and I had quit smoking for a very long time. And it was like five to 11:00 and the store near my house closes at 11:00. And I was, like, rushing to buy cigarettes.</p><p begin="00:19:48.10">And I remember taking the first smoke, and it was like for the first time, I was able to breathe out. I could exhale. And it felt really good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:20:02.99">Things only seemed to be getting worse. The hostages told her that a fifth person had died. And Meron says that's when she reached a turning point.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:20:11.33">That's when I decided, no, I cannot take this. I cannot just sit by and the world is not doing anything. At least I have to save one person. And that's when I decided to do fundraising to collect money for the girl, that Semhar would be the one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:20:32.44">Meron knew that paying ransom was a bad idea. She knew it just encouraged more hostage-taking. And she knew it might not work. The traffickers could take her $20,000 and still not let Semhar go. Also, it was so much money. She'd raised money for causes before, but never that much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:20:49.88">At the beginning, I didn't believe that someone should pay, and I told that if the international community knows about it, they would just send soldiers or something and rescue them. That's the way I was thinking. But then you start realizing that you are on your own. Nobody will save these people.</p><p begin="00:21:08.04">And one by one, they start dying. So I could not take the phone calls that when I called the next day, they would tell me, oh, he just died, and he just died. So when five people died, that's when I decided, who cares if it's wrong or not? But I want to try, at least, to save one person, so that I don't have a guilt feeling that I didn't try.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:21:32.76">So Meron began asking for money. She wrote posts on Facebook and used Paltalk, a social media voice chat where a lot of Eritreans hang out. At night, she went into different chat rooms, making her appeal. She got Eritrean expats in the US, Norway, and the UK to collect money from people in their respective countries.</p><p begin="00:21:51.52">But donations came slowly, $20 here, $50 there. People were reluctant to give money for a ransom payment, understandably. She also had to contend with the internal politics of the Eritrean diaspora. Meron's pretty well-known as a strong opponent of the Eritrean government, and there are still large groups of Eritreans in the diaspora that support the government, so they didn't trust Meron. Some claimed she and the hostages were making the whole situation up to make the government look bad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:22:19.89">They were saying it must be a made up something, like for radio, like a drama or something. They thought I made it up. So I said, well, if you don't believe me, here. Here is a number. You can call them yourself. That was really stupid of me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:22:35.32">It was stupid because people did take the hostages' phone number and started calling them, Biniam and the others, but not for the reason Meron had hoped.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:22:43.00">They started calling and cursing at them, saying, you think you can play us? You're not going to get anything, a cent out of us. And calling them names, and called the girl, that she is a whore, trying to make money out of Eritreans.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:23:00.49">On the phone afterwards, Biniam told Meron it really upset him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:23:04.38">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:23:07.49">They've been calling us all night. They would say we are jihadists, we are swindlers. And they are accusing us of actually trying to get them to send us money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:23:21.13">For Biniam, the fact that people didn't believe them struck at the one thing that was giving him even a shred of optimism, the thought that Meron would be able to rally people on the outside to come to their rescue. He was losing faith in Meron.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:23:33.87">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:23:36.59">We've trusted you, and we become extremely hopeless when we hear such talk coming from you and the other people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:23:44.66">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:23:45.99">Biniam, my brother, I believe you.

Well, if you ever give birth to a boy, please name him Biniam after me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:25:10.27">Some hostages like Biniam, Meron was talking to nearly every day, sometimes several times a day. But there were always new ones, too. One day early on, Meron got a call. The hostage began talking to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:25:22.84">Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:25:23.80">Hello, hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:25:24.83"> [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:25:27.02">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:25:28.84">And after a few minutes, she realized, wait, this isn't the same group of hostages I've been talking to. This is a whole different group of 31 people in the same situation, being tortured and extorted for money in Sinai.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:25:42.40">Somehow they found out about me and they got my number, and then they called and I started talking to them, interviewing them, broadcasting it on the radio. And then after a week or so, then another group heard of me. So it became-- within a month, there was about six different groups of hostages that I was interviewing, like the group with 28 and then 31.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:26:05.42"> Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:26:06.15">Hello, hello?</p><p begin="00:26:07.03">And then the third group were 71 people there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:26:10.67"> Hello.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:26:11.66">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p><p begin="00:26:12.81">And then the fourth were about 150 people. Then I stopped counting. It became too much, that everybody start calling me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:26:24.09">At first, Meron was reluctant to get involved with other groups. But not surprisingly, she got drawn into their situations, as well. And as she spoke to more people, she was able to piece together a clearer picture of the criminal networks that were doing the trafficking. As best she could tell, a small group of Bedouin bosses in Sinai were at the top, but they had connections with gangs of kidnappers in Sudan who would bring them truckloads of people. And they seemed to have agents in different cities around the world who would collect ransoms for them.</p><p begin="00:26:54.21">Meron also learned that there were Eritreans working for the traffickers in the encampments. Some of them are kind of like indentured servants, forced to do construction and cleaning jobs for the traffickers. Others were interpreters, Eritreans who spoke Arabic as well as Tigrinya and served as go-betweens for the Bedouins to help them communicate with the hostages and their families. And in the first hostage group she was talking to, she learned that there was one interpreter in particular named John.</p><p begin="00:27:22.07">She couldn't figure out his place in the hierarchy, whether he was a hostage forced to translate for the traffickers, or if he'd actually joined the ring himself. A former hostage and a hostage's brother warned her that he was shady. But then when she asked Biniam and Semhar if John was working with the Bedouins, they told her he wasn't.</p><p begin="00:27:40.01">So in early April, when John came bearing good news, she didn't know if she could trust him. She'd been asking the traffickers for weeks to lower the ransom, and John brought word that they'd agreed. The new price was $5,000 per person.</p><p begin="00:27:54.60">At this point, Meron had already sent $2,000 for Semhar, so this meant she needed to send just $3,000 more, which was a lot more manageable than the original $20,000 price tag, if the discount was actually for real. She called Biniam to see if it was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:28:09.65">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:28:12.52">So if I pay $3,000 more, he'll let Semhar go? Meron asked Biniam. Yes, Biniam said. If you pay $3,000 more right now, he will let Semhar go.</p><p begin="00:28:24.83">Meron was excited. This was her first break in the whole ordeal. But she soon found out it wasn't that simple.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:34.48">Yowei Shaw. Coming up, things get precisely five times more complicated.

  <h3>Act Two.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:28:50.41">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's show, "This Call May Be Recorded to Save Your Life." We've been hearing the story of Meron Estefanos, a human rights activist and journalist who was trying to save a group of Eritrean hostages who were being held in Sinai.</p><p begin="00:29:03.52">At this point in our story, it's over a month since her first phone call with the hostages. And she's been offered a discount, a break on the price to save one of them, the only woman in the group of 28. Her name was Semhar. Instead of a $20,000 ransom, it would be $5,000 to release her. Release means, in this case, they would drive her to the Israeli border and tell her to run for it.</p><p begin="00:29:24.82">Just to repeat the warning I made at the beginning of the program, this is a story with violence and lives being threatened, and there is some content that is probably not right for younger listeners. Yowei Shaw picks up the story from here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:29:35.94">Meron called John, the Eritrean who was translating for the Bedouin traffickers. She wanted to finalize the deal to get Semhar out. And John said, for sure, he could do this deal. He knew the Bedouins. And as for the hostages, he said he was looking out for them as best as he could in a very difficult situation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John</h4><p begin="00:29:52.21">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:29:53.62">Here's the deal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John</h4><p begin="00:29:54.61">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:29:57.33">These are your brothers and sisters, and you're actually advocating for them, right? Me here, when they try to kill them, I try to protect them. And after they are tortured, I try to clean and dress their wounds. I try to wash the blood off their backs. I've been doing a lot for them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:30:20.46">John said the traffickers would do the deal. They would release Semhar for $5,000, but only if at least four other hostages paid $5,000 each at the same time. In other words, the discount only applied if Meron bought in bulk. A friend of Meron's who was on the call with John tried to push back, but John said, basically, don't tell me how to do my job. Just do yours.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John</h4><p begin="00:30:43.12">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:30:45.36">You just need to focus on sending the money. If you pay for those five people, I will get them to their destination safely.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:30:56.62">Meron was skeptical, but she had no other option. She got in touch with four other families who were willing to pay the discounted ransom. Biniam was not one of these four hostages, by the way. His family was having trouble delivering the money. The families would pay $5,000 for each of their relatives, and Meron would pay $5,000 for Semhar.</p><p begin="00:31:16.60">Meron put out a frantic call to the people around the world who were helping her collect money for Semhar's ransom. And maybe it was the urgency, or maybe it was the fact that $5,000 seemed like a more realistic amount of money to raise than the original $20,000, but people chipped in. Within 48 hours, she had the money she needed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:31:34.85">They asked us to send the money using Western Union, which I did. So I called and asked if they got the money. They said, yeah. And they said, well, I'm rushing right now. We're about to drive them to the border of Israel right now. I'll speak to you tomorrow.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:31:55.43">Meron was so nervous she couldn't sleep. She spent the next 24 hours calling her contacts in Sinai and Israel to see if they had any updates. She tried John again and again. Finally, he picked up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John</h4><p begin="00:32:08.76">Hello, Meron.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:32:09.56">Hello, Johnny.

This is a woman that was helping me, raising money, and we kind of celebrated. You know, I'm thinking, OK, everything is over now. $5,000 is paid and she's out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:32:35.41">And then Meron got a call from the brother of one of the other hostages who was supposed to have been freed to Israel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:32:41.50">And said, you know, they are playing with us, because my brother just called me and he told me that he's in Sinai, and now they're asking for $15,000 more. So it was all a game.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:32:53.16">Meron phoned John and asked about Semhar.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:32:55.94">I called and said, how could you do this to me?

They begged Meron to free them now, too.</p><p begin="00:33:53.44">But she didn't believe them. Her plan had completely failed. It had been five weeks since her first phone call with the hostages. And now she thought John was trying to get more money out of her by forcing the hostages to say these things. Biniam got on the phone.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:34:07.52">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:34:08.80">How you been?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:34:09.68">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:34:11.66">I'm not doing well, Biniam.

It wasn't long before she called Biniam and the other hostages again. But John and the traffickers prohibited them from speaking to her like they used to.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:34:57.53">Whenever I called, they would tell them to call me names. They would force them to call me names, and at the beginning, I was really hurt. They were saying the same thing. Don't call us here, you whore. And, we don't need you. You're just making money out of us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:35:13.91">Eventually, Biniam, Semhar, and the rest of the group stopped talking to Meron completely.</p><p begin="00:35:25.89">It's been more than two years since that happened. Meron kept talking to other hostages on the phone, dozens of them. And without ever meaning to, she became one of the people Eritrean hostages and their families turn to for help. In those years, she's learned about the different traffickers and the different tricks they use, which traffickers can be relied on to let people go once they've paid, and which ones can't.</p><p begin="00:35:50.26">One former hostage described Meron's phone calls this way. She said when she talked to her family from the torture camp, all they would do is panic and freak out. Meron, on the other hand, was mostly calm and comforting. She'd give you clear updates and tell you what was being done to help. It was a relief.</p><p begin="00:36:08.48">Meron isn't sure how many hostages she's helped get free over the years.

From the outside, the place they were held looked like the foundation of a house with a corrugated metal roof placed on top of it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:37:13.45"> [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:37:16.75">We don't see nothing. We are in the darkness. We are in the underground. Everything is dark. The only time we're going out, it's to use the bathroom, and only in the nighttime. And when we go out, you smell people smell, like dead body smell. Because everybody dying, they'd throw them out at this place just right outside.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:37:40.97">Who was holding you?

And those who are really guarding us, these are the youngest ones. They'd been in the age of 20 or something.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:38:15.11">What was the demeanor of the torturers like--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:38:18.13">That's my producer, Brian.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:38:19.63">--when they're doing these things to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:38:22.55">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:38:25.57">Yeah, they need to be stoned to come and torture you. You can see that they took drugs because their eyes changed. They've been so red, and they look so angry, their eyes. And they're acting like they are angry, but they're also playing around while they're beating you up. They're laughing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:38:53.97">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:38:56.12">They have to take drugs. They are not that tough.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:39:01.79">How often did you guys exaggerate or lie to Meron because you were being forced to?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:39:08.82">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:39:11.80">Many times, so many times.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:39:14.75">Biniam told us that John, the Eritrean who was working with the traffickers, was constantly standing over them on the calls, telling the hostages to make things sound as horrible as possible. That the traffickers were going to kill them now. That they'd harvest their organs. The hostages came to understand these were bluffs. And when Biniam told Meron that Semhar and the four other hostages had been freed, in fact, they were sitting right there in the room.</p><p begin="00:39:39.63">But Biniam and another hostage from his group that we spoke to said the torture they described on the phone to Meron was all real. It would have been hard to exaggerate, Biniam said, because it was so awful. He and the other hostage both remember at least four people who died while in captivity.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:39:56.04">How does the phone work, exactly? Do you guys have a lot of access to it? Or is it totally under the control of the guards and the traffickers?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:40:05.25">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:40:07.72">We can't touch the phone. There is this [INAUDIBLE]. This is the translator. His name is John. He will put the phone on our ears while we speak in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Brian Reed</h4><p begin="00:40:22.77"> So wait, you never were hold-- like, we've listened to a lot of recordings of you talking to Meron. Through all of those, you were never actually holding the phone yourself?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:40:34.36">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:40:36.12">Yeah, we not touching the phone. We not touching the phone at all, because they afraid we send messages.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:40:44.62">So picture Meron's first phone call from Biniam's perspective. He's lying on the ground, shackled, blindfolded, almost completely in darkness. All of a sudden, John comes up to him and holds a cellphone to his ear. There's a woman's voice on the line saying hello, she's from Sweden, and she's on the case, telling him to stay strong and not to worry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:41:05.41">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:41:10.66"> I thought, like, it's a dream, the first call I had with her. And the other way, I was suspicious, because I thought, is it maybe a girl from another room being tortured like us, trying to convince us to talk to our family to get the money?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:41:32.79">So when Biniam first spoke to Meron, he felt the same way about her that she felt about him. He didn't know if she was trustworthy. But as Meron called more and more, he noticed that it put the traffickers in a better mood. They became encouraged that money was on the way.</p><p begin="00:41:47.20">It seemed genuine. Sometimes they took his blindfold off to let him speak to her. And sometimes, amazingly, after a call from Meron, the traffickers wouldn't torture the hostages.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:41:57.31">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:41:59.66">We'd been tortured every night, but there were nights when she calls, we'd not been tortured. We'd be sleeping without being tortured because of her call.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:42:08.36">And Meron did something else for Biniam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:42:10.42">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:42:13.50">Before Meron called, I was not calling my family. I'm coming from a very poor family. $20,000, I have never seen that before. So I never thought about asking my family. That's like giving them pain. Asking for $20,000, it means like torturing them. The best thing to do was let them think that I'm already dead.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:42:40.19">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:42:41.97">But then Meron called. She pushed me to call my family. She pushed me. She told me, tell them. Maybe they can do something. She gave me the idea. I would never do that. She gave me hope.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:42:55.00">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:43:01.60">Biniam listened to Meron. He called his family and asked for the money. And to his utter surprise, they were able to scrounge together more than $10,000, getting money from relatives as far as Germany, Angola, and the United States. Biniam says they sent the money to John, but John told Biniam he never got it.</p><p begin="00:43:21.08">Biniam was sold to another group of traffickers with Semhar. This was a group that was worse than the first. They raped Semhar in front of him. Other awful things happened, until finally, one day, a guard came up to Biniam and took his chains off.</p><p begin="00:43:34.34">He was so weak, he could barely walk. So he rested at the camp for five days before the traffickers drove him and some other hostages to an area near the Israeli border. They crawled through a hole in what Biniam hoped was the border fence. Eventually, some soldiers came up to him and told him he was in Israel. When he got access to a phone, he called Meron.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:43:54.43">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:44:00.66">She didn't even believe that I'm calling her from Israel. She was like-- we didn't talk, we were crying, both of us. Meron is actually everything for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:44:11.51">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:44:17.07">With the voice I hear from her, I feel more than I feel for my mother's voice. I owe her my life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:44:35.64">Biniam's doing pretty well, considering. He has a job as a housekeeper at a hotel. He's slowly trying to pay his family back the thousands they raised for his ransom. To unwind, he writes poetry and songs, though he hasn't written about Sinai yet.</p><p begin="00:44:50.85">But life in Israel is hard. Biniam still has injuries. He limps. His eyesight is impaired. He has trouble using his hands because he was chained for so long, which means his job making hotel beds is difficult. He applied for asylum when he arrived in Israel, but he says the government hasn't given him an answer on that. That means he gets no assistance with medical care, no legal work permit.</p><p begin="00:45:14.64">And he's not alone. This is, in practice, Israel's policy towards migrants. In the most recent figures available from the UN High Commissioner of Refugees, Israel granted refugee status to less than 1% of people who might qualify, the lowest rate of any developed country. A US State Department report declared in 2012 that the Israeli government doesn't even process asylum applications from Eritreans.</p><p begin="00:45:47.20">As best as we can tell, of the 29 hostages Biniam was originally held with, at least four died, one disappeared, one went back to Eritrea, and the rest, over 20 of them, are now in Israel. They try to get together when they can. Biniam says most of them are doing OK.</p><p begin="00:46:05.96">But you don't go through an experience like this and just move on. One last warning-- this next quote gets graphic. Here's Biniam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:46:14.26">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:46:14.93">In my mind, I don't really get over it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:46:17.91">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:46:24.80">It's like every second, like it's walking around with me.

I just open my eyes and I see her, raping her, like eight people at one time, eight people on one girl. And I was praying for her to die.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:46:54.49">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:46:57.88">It was-- that's the time she was drived crazy, where she get lost, mental lost.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Biniam</h4><p begin="00:47:04.38">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Translator</h4><p begin="00:47:07.68">And I see that all the time, again and again.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:47:13.35">Biniam says Semhar's the person from his group who's doing the worst. She eventually made it to Israel, but only after an epic ordeal that went on long after Meron paid the $5,000 for her. She told Meron the whole story in an interview afterwards. Once a trafficker cut off Semhar from Meron and demanded $15,000 more, Semhar's mother in Eritrea, who is very poor, scraped together the money by begging people and taking loans. She sent it to the trafficker. Here's Meron.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:47:41.00">And then he tried to sell her to another house. And when he took her to another house, they said, call your mom. She said no, over my dead body. You can kill me, but she refused to call to her mother. They keep torturing her, torturing her, and she refused. She said, just kill me. I'm not calling anyone begging for more money.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:48:03.65">Finally, these new traffickers cut their losses and dropped Semhar near the Israeli border. They told her to climb the fence to get into Israel. Semhar was weak for months at the torture camp, and before she could get across the fence, Egyptian guards spotted her and shot her in the leg.</p><p begin="00:48:20.54">They took Semhar to a hospital in Egypt, where she got treatment. Eventually, Semhar told her story to a nurse who felt sorry for her. The nurse brought Semhar home for a while and later paid a smuggler to take her to Israel, where she lives today. Meron eventually went to visit her. Semhar still has injuries and pain, which make it hard for her to work. Plus, Meron says--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:48:42.02">She's now in a very bad situation where it's really hard to communicate, like mentally, she's not well. When we met, we hugged and we start crying, both of us. But suddenly, you know, she just fainted as I was hugging her. She fainted.</p><p begin="00:49:00.81">And then subconsciously, you know, she would get up and start screaming, you whore, don't touch me! And she would hit anyone that's near her. So it took about five, ten minutes.</p><p begin="00:49:13.55">And then after that, she woke up, and she was like, hi, Meron, how are you? I'm so happy to see you. And so she's talking like a normal thing, like nothing has happened. And she doesn't remember what she just had done.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:49:27.98">Meron tried to get Semhar to start seeing a doctor to help her deal with the trauma. But Semhar refused. She was living with a man in Tel Aviv who claimed to be a healer who could help exorcise her demons, and he wouldn't let her seek standard medical help. After Meron's trip to Israel, she pretty much lost touch with Semhar.</p><p begin="00:49:54.82">In July 2012, on her trip to Israel, Meron did something she'd been waiting to do since she first started talking to the hostages, meet some of them face to face. She sent word to former hostages that anyone who wanted to meet her should come to Levinsky Park, a place in Tel Aviv where a lot of Eritreans go.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 1</h4><p begin="00:50:13.05"> Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man 2</h4><p begin="00:50:13.86"> Hi.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:50:14.65">Meron got there in the early evening. A filmmaker was with her, shooting video. She was excited, anxious.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:50:21.43">We're going to meet them, yeah.</p><p begin="00:50:24.07">And far away, I could see a lot of people sitting on the grass. I was expecting about five or six would come to see me, but there were so many of them, you know?</p><p begin="00:50:35.59">They are here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:50:36.44">What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:50:36.88">These are the people. Hi. Hi.</p><p begin="00:50:43.30">Everybody stood up. I remember one of them came first and hugged me, and I was just, you know, I just start crying.</p><p begin="00:50:52.81">Oh. [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p><p begin="00:50:57.81">Asking, who are you? And he would say this person, and then the next person, and the next person.</p><p begin="00:51:03.11">[SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:51:06.29"> [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:51:10.71">About 20 people stood in a circle around Meron. She went up to each of them, one by one, and hugged them. There was a man whose cousin Meron had convinced to pay his ransom. I'm so happy you guys made it out safely, Meron said to him as they hugged. I'm so happy that I've seen you alive.</p><p begin="00:51:27.86">Another was a 14-year-old girl whose ransom Meron had paid with money she raised herself. The girl broke down in tears as soon as Meron got close to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:51:36.02">Oh my god. [WEEPING] [SPEAKING TIGRINYA]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:51:52.56">The group headed to a restaurant. Meron bought a round of beers. She seemed giddy. She was talking a lot, way more than the hostages, telling stories about this phone call or that phone call, about the time people thought the hostages were lying and making up a radio drama, or about the time she told John the translator off.</p><p begin="00:52:15.08">This is Meron's life now. Her kids are 12 and 4 years old. She still covers the torture camps on the radio. She helps other reporters do stories, too, speaks about Sinai at conferences.</p><p begin="00:52:26.86">And she used her recordings to co-author a lengthy report that was submitted to the European Union Parliament. A few months ago, she even went to Sinai for the first time to try and get local sheiks to address the hostage problem. And then, of course, she still gets phone calls from hostages and their families all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:52:45.69">My life has changed totally. Like I don't know how to lead a normal life right now, because I feel bad if I'm laughing. I feel bad if I'm going out.</p><p begin="00:52:54.95">Sometimes they would make a missed call while I'm eating my dinner. I try to talk to them while I'm eating, but I try to chew as slow as I can so that they don't notice that I'm eating. Because I would feel bad that I'm eating and they don't have anything to eat. I mean, that has become my life.</p><p begin="00:53:12.90">This has become my call for life, actually. Like I just feel that this was meant for me, and this is my call. I see it as part of my life, stopping this. I see them as my family.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:53:34.48"> When was the last time you talked to a hostage?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Meron Estefanos</h4><p begin="00:53:39.76">Yeah, last night, around midnight.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Yowei Shaw</h4><p begin="00:53:51.40">It's hard to know for sure what things are like in Sinai now. A spokesperson for Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told me hostage-taking has decreased and that they're trying to stop it. But he also said they've yet to convict anyone involved in the trafficking. And as you heard, Meron is still getting calls. Human rights groups say there's no evidence to suggest that the problem has gone away.</p><p begin="00:54:15.28">It's not easy to get accurate numbers on this, but two groups who interview former hostages once they make it to Israel, the Hotline for Migrant Workers and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, estimate that there are roughly 7,000 people living there who are held for ransom in Sinai. They're also hearing from fewer people who have gotten out of torture camps, because very few former hostages make it into Israel these days.</p><p begin="00:54:38.73">Last year, Israel completed most of its work building a fence along its border with Egypt, and there's a new law that allows police to detain anyone illegally crossing the border for years without trial. In 2012, the interior minister publicly stated that the purpose of the law was to make their lives in Israel unbearable. And now Israel is sending detained Eritreans back to Eritrea, back to the government they were trying to escape in the first place. The first planeload of 14 Eritreans left Israel last month.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:17.74">Yowei Shaw.
