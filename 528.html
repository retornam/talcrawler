  <h3>Prologue.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.31">Hi, everybody. I'm speaking to you today from the stage of an opera house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City.</p><p begin="00:00:05.43">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:00:06.68"/></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:00:07.87">A warning to listeners that there is mild cursing throughout this hour, and on the podcast, we're not going to beep that. And I'm here on an opera house stage with a story that is so small, it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this grand. It's actually about a real opera singer-- not a super-famous opera singer or anything like that. Carin Gilfry makes about half of her living singing. The other half she makes recording audio books.</p><p begin="00:00:31.86">And about a year ago, she was staying at a hotel. And she had a deadline on this children's book that she was supposed to be recording, and the hotel room was kind of noisy. She was hearing a lot of noise from the street. And so she looked around for a quiet place, and she went into the closet-- put pillows all around to deaden the sound, sat on the floor with a microphone. And then the cord of the microphone went under the door of the closet out to her laptop, because her laptop had a fan that made noise.</p><p begin="00:00:58.30">And so she closes the door so it's pitch dark except for the light from her iPad, which had the text of the book that she was supposed to read. And she began.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carin Gilfry</h4><p begin="00:01:07.75"><i>The</i> <i>Exciting</i> <i>Exploits</i> <i>of</i> <i>an</i> <i>Effervescent</i> <i>Elf</i>, written by Trisha Sugarek and narrated by Carin Gilfry.

And she stumbles on a word, and she decides, oh wait, I'll just start again. I'll just start from the beginning.</p><p begin="00:01:46.13">So she gets up to get out of the closet and start the tape again, start the recording again.

It's journalism, like we always do, but presented as radio drama. And we think these are radio dramas like you have never heard before.

We have journalism turned into a play that is structured like a radio documentary.</p><p begin="00:11:08.86">The fact is, there are so many ways you can tell a true story. There are so, so many ways.

  <h3>Act One. 21 Chump Street: The Musical.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:20:00.80">Which brings us to act one. Act One, "21 Chump Street, the Musical." I've always wondered what it would mean to try one of our radio stories as a musical. I was taken to so many musicals as a kid. And I think because of that, my basic sense of what makes a satisfying story actually comes from musicals much more than from TV or movies.</p><p begin="00:20:23.39">If you think about, like, the classic old musicals-- <i>Fiddler</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>Roof</i> or even <i>A</i> <i>Chorus</i> <i>Line</i>-- it's like, they're funny at the beginning. And then there's something really emotional. And they're about some bigger idea. They take you into this world. I just love that.</p><p begin="00:20:37.79">And so what you're about to hear is our first attempt at a musical based on journalism. Probably 70% to 80% of what you're about to hear is verbatim quotes from interviews. The rest is artistic invention. I'll say that upfront.</p><p begin="00:20:51.29">It's based on a true story you may remember from our radio program. Back in May, 2011, at a bunch of high schools in Palm Beach County, Florida, a group of young police officers were sent undercover to pose as students. They went to classes. They ate in the cafeteria. They had fake Facebook accounts, of course.</p><p begin="00:21:08.18">There had been complaints about drugs being sold at these schools. That's what they were there to deal with. And what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on Broadway. Pretty much everybody involved in this, the cast, the chorus, the musicians, the director, Michael Mayer-- all from Broadway.

  <h3>Act Two. Of Mice and Men.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:37:58.41">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today, from the stage of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York City, the radio drama episode.</p><p begin="00:38:08.81">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:38:11.29"/></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:38:12.79">We have journalism, memoir, true stories ed as radio drama. We have arrived at act two of our show. Act Two, "Of Mice and Men." So this next bit of radio drama is not an experiment for us like a musical or an opera. We thought it would be smart to have one story in today's show where we know what we're doing. A type of radio drama we actually bring you now and then on the program, a true story told on stage by the person that it actually happened to. Please welcome comedian Mike Birbiglia.</p><p begin="00:38:44.67">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:38:47.14"/></div><div class="host"><h4>Mike Birbiglia</h4><p begin="00:38:55.54">Wow. It's pretty easy following a musical.</p><p begin="00:39:11.51">I, uh-- I think that my favorite thing about being married is actually that you can share jokes with your wife or husband that are funny to you and that person and no one else other than maybe your cat. Because when you have a cat, your barometer for humor, poof, out the window.</p><p begin="00:39:38.93">Last summer, my wife and I went on a trip to Massachusetts. And I called it Cats-achusetts-- which is not funny, but in our house was the joke of the year. I was like, we're going to Cats-achusetts. My life is like, ahh! I was like, ahh! Our cat was like, ahh!</p><p begin="00:40:03.42">Everyone loves a good pun when you have a cat. And so we drive to Cats-achusetts. And when we arrive, my wife has a headache. And she asks me if I'll acclimate Ivan-- that's our cat-- to the bedroom, because you can't just put an indoor cat into a house, because he'll explode.</p><p begin="00:40:22.31">And so I bring him in the bedroom. But I'm so tired from the drive that I fall asleep, which is the only thing you cannot do when acclimating an indoor cat to a house. And so I wake up an hour later. Ivan is gone. He got out.</p><p begin="00:40:35.52">And so now I'm running around the house. I'm like, my cat's going to explode. I wake up my wife. I was like, Clo-- her name's Jen-- I say, Mr. Fantastic is gone-- his name's Ivan. And Clo gave me a look that I can only describe as "divorce eyes."</p><p begin="00:41:03.80">Because before that, point I was convinced that we would be married forever. And then once I saw the divorce eyes, I was like, oh, I guess this could end. And if it ended, it would look a lot like that.</p><p begin="00:41:16.97">And so now the two of us are running around the house. I'm like, my marriage is falling apart. My cat's going to explode. And we find Ivan, but we had another major problem in the house, which is that there were mice in the house.</p><p begin="00:41:37.94">It was actually worse than that, because they were parasitic mice. They have what's called toxoplasmosis, which means they have a-- yeah, you might know what this is. They have a parasite in them, and as a result they're unafraid of cats, and they're unafraid of people.</p><p begin="00:41:53.09">And the way we discovered this was that my wife was watching TV, and she looked next to her. And there was a mouse. And he was watching TV also. And she screamed!</p><p begin="00:42:11.55">And he just looked up at her like Stuart Little-- like, hey, what's going on? I don't like this show either. I don't know why all those women would want to marry that one guy.</p><p begin="00:42:29.01">And then she pushed him off the couch. And he didn't even run away. He didn't even scurry, which is a verb invented for mice. He just walked into the kitchen, like a roommate-- like, fine! I'll go in the other room! I just think you're overreacting.</p><p begin="00:42:50.39">And then he did a confessional into the Mouse Cam in the kitchen. He was like, I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win. I was here before they came. I'll be here when they're gone. I'm a mouse.</p><p begin="00:43:06.50">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:43:08.48"/></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:43:14.42">That's from "Real Mouse-wives of Cats-achusetts." That night, I'm sound asleep, and my wife wakes me up by grabbing my face. She says, Mo-- my name's Mike-- Mr. Fantastic found the mouse. You need to get the mouse.</p><p begin="00:43:41.59">And I sit up, and I say Clo, we have a cat. We do everything for the cat. We gave him food. We give him an apartment that he thinks is the world. We set aside an area in the apartment for him to poop in that we clean more often than the area where we poop.</p><p begin="00:44:12.95">We have a gentleman's agreement that in the unlikely event that a mouse should walk in that door (A LA MARLON BRANDO) that he will kill that mouse and we will never speak of that mouse again. And he will be protected. (NORMAL VOICE) That's from "Cat-father."</p><p begin="00:44:38.55">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:44:41.47"/></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:44:47.33">My wife says, Mo, get the mouse. And I sit up, and I see what may be the strangest tableau I will ever witness in my entire life. Ivan's smacking the mouse. The mouse flies in the air, lands, gets up, walks back towards Ivan.</p><p begin="00:45:07.38">Ivan smacks the mouse, flies in the air, lands, gets up, walks back towards Ivan. Ivan is thrilled! His toy is alive!</p><p begin="00:45:26.90">I have a serious sleepwalking disorder. So as I am watching this, I'm not even really sure it's happening. I'm thinking, I've had this dream before.</p><p begin="00:45:40.28">My wife says, Mo, get the mouse. And she hands me a cup.</p><p begin="00:45:50.19">I sit up. I walk towards the mouse. And the mouse walks towards me. I put the cup over the mouse. I put a magazine under the cup. I take the cup into the backyard, and I put the mouse into the forest, where I can only assume that he walked into the mouth of a wolf.</p><p begin="00:46:25.10">And from that day forward, we have called it Mouse-achusetts.</p><p begin="00:46:29.55">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:46:32.50"/></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:46:40.85">I want to point out something really special that happened there at the end. A few minutes ago, I prefaced this story with a Massachusetts-based pun, Cats-achusetts, which we all agreed as a group is not funny.</p><p begin="00:47:04.48">Just moments ago, I concluded the story with another Massachusetts-based pun that was nearly identical. And that was Mouse-achusetts. And we applauded.</p><p begin="00:47:27.55">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:47:29.41"/></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:47:34.36">Which means, in a way, it's like we're married.</p><p begin="00:47:40.94">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:47:43.89"/></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:48.31">Mike Birbiglia.

  <h3>Act Three.  How Do You Slow This Thing Down. (Podcast Only)</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:48:09.71">We have arrived at act three of our show. Act Three, "How do you Slow this Thing Down?"</p><p begin="00:48:16.35">So this story is a follow up to a story that we ran a couple of years ago, which was a full episode of our show about one of our contributors, Josh Bearman, and his family. The set-up is that Josh's parents got divorced when he was very young. And he and his brother Ethan grew up with their dad, who's a physicist, out in suburban Los Angeles.</p><p begin="00:48:35.11">Josh's mom and his half-brother David lived very differently. They drifted around. They ended up in Florida. They were barely keeping it together. Josh's mom was an alcoholic. David was an aspiring rapper getting acquainted with the court system</p><p begin="00:48:50.63">Together they lived in this tiny condo in a retirement community in West Palm Beach called Century Village, where they did not belong. They were not retirees. And they would get into various kinds of jams and crises. And Josh would have to fly to Florida to try to help. He ended up spending a lot of time there.</p><p begin="00:49:06.93">What you are about to hear is an experiment at creating a radio drama which has exactly the same structure as one of the documentary stories on our show. And so what's going to happen is the real Josh Bearman is going to narrate. And then instead of going to, like, quotes on tape or things like that, we have actors performing scenes that really happened. All of this really happened. In those scenes, Josh is played by Josh Hamilton. His brother David is played by James Ransone.</p><p begin="00:49:33.11">The story begins last year when real-life Josh found himself back in Florida with his two brothers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Bearman</h4><p begin="00:49:41.95">My mother's been in the hospital so much by now she's figured out how to direct the paramedics, like emergency chauffeurs or something, to all of the best facilities. Her room at Wellington Regional is big and bright. It's a corner room with big windows and a nice view. Although she can't see it, because right now she's connected to state-of-the-art equipment behind a curtain.</p><p begin="00:50:02.03">[SOUNDS OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT]</p><p begin="00:50:02.64">When I walk in, my brother David is there already.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:06.76">Hey, man. Oh, this whole thing was like a fucked-up remix of "The Night Before Christmas," because it was the night before Christmas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:50:13.92">Is this story gonna be in rhyme, or--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:15.69">Shut up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:50:17.17">David, what happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:18.96">You know how she gets around the holidays. I mean, I thought that you and Ethan were going to bring her out to California.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:50:23.83">Oh, man. I don't know why we didn't. I think it was Ethan's schedule. Or we probably just didn't try hard enough.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:29.80">Nah, nah. I mean, you never know when she's going to get all twisted like that. And I wasn't even really around anyway.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:50:36.58">Where were you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:38.04">I was with this girl from school, this girl Tasha. And I went over to her house early on Christmas Eve, because they were having turkey dinner and everything-- you know, like a normal family.</p><p begin="00:50:47.48">I mean, I had to get out of Century Village. I was cooped up in there with Mom, and she was driving me crazy. So anyway, I'm at Tasha's. And Mom calls, and she sounds all drunk, right? And she's like, something happened to the car.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:50:58.17">Something hap-- what kind of something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:50:59.98">I don't know! That's what I said!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:02.06">That's like something you would tell me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:51:03.89">I know. And now I know how you feel. Well, whatever happened, the car got stuck, right? And I didn't have any way to get to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:12.93">So how did she get home?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:51:14.72">I think Peggy picked her up. And by the time I got back to the condo the next day, she was-- she was pretty deep in it. But it didn't seem like that big of a deal really. And then she woke up, and she was short of breath, so I was like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:28.25">Wait, wait, wait. For how long?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:51:31.10">Tuesday, so for, like, a day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:33.72">And you didn't call me sooner?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:51:35.31">Dude, she's done this shit, like, a million times. I mean, she wasn't even that worried about it. And she didn't want me to ride in the ambulance with her. She was like, I'll see you later tonight, Dave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:51:44.21">Hi, I'm Dr. Snyder. Are-- are you the older brother?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:50.05">Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:51:51.02">You have the medical power of attorney?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:52.67">Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:51:53.12">Good. And who's Ethan?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:56.66">Our other brother. He's also coming from California.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:51:58.15">He has the medical power of attorney?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:51:59.89">Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:52:01.73">Not him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:52:03.28">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:52:04.99">OK. Oh, uh, did your mother go to Cornell?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:52:10.78">Yes, why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:52:12.32">She told us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:52:13.60">What else did she say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="00:52:14.90">That she does not consume alcohol.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Bearman</h4><p begin="00:52:19.39">Those were her last words before going under. Soon enough, withdrawal told a very different story. The first time this happened was five years ago, when David called and told me he had to remit himself to the local sheriff's office for, quote, "just a quick jail sentence." Oh, and Mom's in the hospital.</p><p begin="00:52:40.40">So I flew to Florida that next day and went straight to the ICU.</p><p begin="00:52:43.17">[SOUND OF AIRPLANE FLYING OVERHEAD]</p><p begin="00:52:43.77">And here's what happened that time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Orderly</h4><p begin="00:52:46.60">Well, looks like she'll never be the same again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:52:50.58"> What, are you the neurologist?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Orderly</h4><p begin="00:52:52.89">Oh, I see we have a savvy medical consumer here. No. It's 2:00 AM. I'm just the guy on rotation. So she scored low on the GOAT test, which measures brain function.

I took it myself for practice in nursing school. I got, like, an 80.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nurse 1</h4><p begin="00:53:19.15">Yeah, for a perfect score, you'd have to be, like, Superman or something.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Orderly</h4><p begin="00:53:22.18">No, no, no. You know who could get 100? What's that guy-- you know, that guy who can do anything including karate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nurse 1</h4><p begin="00:53:30.02">Leonardo da Vinci.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Orderly</h4><p begin="00:53:33.77">No, no, no. He's dead. He would score poorly. [CHUCKLING] I was just--</p><p begin="00:53:39.64">No, the-- the speaker guy who can do anything! Jesus Christ, if I was him, I'd never forget anyone's name. Uh-- he helps you realize your full potential. He's six and a half feet tall. Come on, ladies. He's, uh--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:53:55.20">Tony Robbins?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Orderly</h4><p begin="00:53:56.50">Yes. Exactly. That guy. That guy, he could score 100.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Josh Bearman</h4><p begin="00:54:07.87">So as the medical professionals discussed how awakening the giant within can totally boost your neurological scores, one of the other nurses came and told me that earlier they had had to restrain my mom because even though she was unconscious, she'd somehow managed to get a hold of cigarettes. They caught her trying to light one in bed. We're not even sure where she got it, the nurse said.</p><p begin="00:54:33.15">And that's when I knew my mother would be fine. Within days, she was sitting up, completely lucid, chatting up strangers-- everyone's favorite.</p><p begin="00:54:44.67">This time, things were bad enough that I called my brother Ethan. He can only come in a true emergency because he plays for the LA Philharmonic, and he has a couple kids, and his schedule's planned out months in advance. He took the red-eye straight from playing at Disney Hall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ethan</h4><p begin="00:55:00.56">Well, here we are again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:55:02.54">How you doing, man?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ethan</h4><p begin="00:55:03.58">I'm so glad you're here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Josh</h4><p begin="00:55:04.80">Thanks for coming.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ethan</h4><p begin="00:55:05.73">Hey, buddy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:55:06.18">Good to see you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ethan</h4><p begin="00:55:06.78">You holding up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>David</h4><p begin="00:55:07.41">Yeah, I'm all right.

And that's true. One of the few real senses of family I can recall was summers in the Midwest with her when we were all children years ago. And we made ice cream and caught fireflies and roller skated-- normal things like that. That's why David doesn't like being in the room much now, because he doesn't want to remember Mom like this, trapped in so many tubes. It's like some jacked-up Darth Vader shit, he says.</p><p begin="00:57:30.30">And yet, he's the one who's been at her bedside the most. I can't bring myself to kiss her the way David does. I don't know why.</p><p begin="00:57:42.70">After Ethan goes back to California, I stay with David and Mom. Time is merciless in Florida and especially merciless in the ICU.

That's a gas station down on Okeechobee Boulevard. And Victory's a total misnomer for the kind of place where you pull in and just see a bunch of weird dudes crouching around the entrance, like it's a totally normal social spot.</p><p begin="01:00:03.46">And David knows everyone here, which is weird. And I'm pretty sure something illicit is happening but I don't want to ask, because I don't want to be The Man with David. And he probably wouldn't tell me anyhow. Ah, it's nothing, David says. Sure, just your regular nighttime rendezvous in the parking lot of an off-brand gas station.</p><p begin="01:00:23.63">David gets back in the car, and he says, all right, I'm good. But I'm not so sure. It's weird, but Mom and David are a team-- like a fucked-up crazy team for a long time, but a team nonetheless. And they've taken care of each other. And the question on my mind is if Mom doesn't make it whether David will.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dr. Snyder</h4><p begin="01:00:42.37">All right, guys.

But I've been here the whole time-- when Mom fell and knocked herself out or when I found her in the backyard or when I took her to get the last of her teeth removed. I wish it was different, but it is what it is. Mom is my best friend.</p><p begin="01:03:40.37">And you, you're gonna get to go home. And I'm going to be the one who's stranded here.

I think David's right. She knows.</p><p begin="01:04:11.20">Each time, her grip gets a little stronger. I look in her terrified eyes and see my own. One night, just before I leave for the day, she takes my hand with both of hers. It's the biggest show of purpose in weeks. And for a second, I don't see the tubes, the room, the cracked lips, or her papery fingers. No one else is here. It's just us.</p><p begin="01:04:37.04">The next morning, there was a message on my phone from the hospice before I got up. I know-- they always say it was peaceful.
