So you bought a rat, and you brought it to NPR headquarters in Washington, DC?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:19.20">We did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:19.35">Alix bought the rat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:20.54">I did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:21.54">And where at NPR did you bring the rat to?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:24.04">We ferreted it into a little kind of edit booth type thing--</p><p begin="00:00:30.63">[GIGGLING]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:32.13">Hi, buddy!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:32.84">--type office. And we invited people into the room one by one.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:37.80">So can you just describe what we got here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:40.00">It's a rat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:40.89">Pinkish ears.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 2</h4><p begin="00:00:42.29">Red eyes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 3</h4><p begin="00:00:42.90">Long nose.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:00:43.81">And sat them down in front of this rat and asked this question.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:00:47.84">Do you think that the thoughts that you have in your head-- OK, the private thoughts that you have in your head-- could influence how that rat moves through space?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:58.84">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:00:59.51">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 2</h4><p begin="00:00:59.75">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 3</h4><p begin="00:01:00.61">No.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:01.04">And it was almost unanimous. People did not believe that their personal thoughts would have any effect on the rat at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 4</h4><p begin="00:01:08.38">Because that would suggest some sort of telepathy which I don't have.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:12.57">And Ira, maybe that's what you think too.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:14.82">That is what I think. I don't think that people thinking thoughts will affect a rat's behavior.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:19.71">Well, you're wrong.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:22.48">No.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:01:23.66">(CHUCKLING) Yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:26.02">OK, so who's this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:27.34">This is a man named Bob Rosenthal. He's a research psychologist. And early in his career, he did this thing. He went into his lab late at night and hung signs on all of the rat cages. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly smart. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly dumb, even though neither of those things was true.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:01:51.30">They were very average rats that you would buy from a research institute that sells rats for a living.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:01:58.82">So then Bob brings this group of experimenters into his lab, and he says, for the next week, some of you are going to get these incredibly smart rats. And some of you are going to get these incredibly stupid rats. And your job is to run your rat through a maze and record how well it does.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:02:15.71">Can you just pick up the rat?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:17.57">So, Ira, we actually did a very lo-fi, unscientific version of this in that little room in NPR.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:24.47">They let you do that?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:26.36">We didn't ask permission.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 4</h4><p begin="00:02:28.10">Is that OK to do?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:02:29.48">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:29.73">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:02:30.42">And you've probably already guessed where this is going.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:32.78">Yeah. In Bob's real study, the experimenters ran the rats that they had been told were smart.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Female Speaker 1</h4><p begin="00:02:37.91">She has sort of an intelligent looking face.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:40.24">And the rats they had been told were dumb.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Male Speaker 4</h4><p begin="00:02:42.26">Yeah, he seems kind of lazy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:44.75">It was not even close.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:02:48.24">The results were so dramatic.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:49.88">In Bob's real study, the smart rats did almost twice as well as the dumb rats.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:54.97">Wait, even though they were the same?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:02:56.76">Yeah, even though the smart rats were not smart and the dumb rats were not dumb. They were all just the same average kind of lab rat. It was so shocking, people didn't really believe him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:03:08.83">I was having trouble publishing any of this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:11.34">And so what was going on? Like, what was actually happening to make the rats do this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:03:15.82">So what Bob figured out was that the expectations that the experimenters carried in their heads subtly changed the way that the experimenters touched the rats, and that changed the way that the rats behaved. So when the experimenters thought that the rats were really smart, they felt more warmly towards the rats. And so they touched them more gently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:03:38.53">We do know that handling rats and handling them more gently can actually increase the performance of rats.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:53.42">And how does this play out when it comes to people? How do our expectations of other people work?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:03:59.37">Well, what you saw in the rats totally holds for people too. I talked to Carol Dweck, who's a psychologist and researcher at Stanford.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carol Dweck</h4><p begin="00:04:06.62">You may be standing farther away from someone you have lower expectations for. You may not be making as much eye contact. And it's not something you can put your finger on. We are not usually aware of how we are conveying our expectations to other people. But it's there.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:04:25.83">And it happens in all kinds of areas. Research has shown that a teacher's expectations can raise or lower a student's IQ score, that a mother's expectations influences the drinking behavior of her middle schooler, that military trainers' expectations can literally make a soldier run faster or slower. So my question was-- you know, how far does this go?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:04:50.66">So Carol, clearly these expectation effects exist on a continuum. So for example, if I expect that if somebody jumps off a building, they will be able to fly, that's not going to work out so well, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carol Dweck</h4><p begin="00:05:04.67">Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:05:05.29">So what does science know about where we should draw the line? Does it have a clear sense of that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Carol Dweck</h4><p begin="00:05:11.17">No. That line is moving. As we come to understand things that are possible and mechanisms through which a belief affects an outcome or one person affects another person, that line can move.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:36.09">Well, from WBEZ, Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. Today on our program, we have a kind of hard to believe example of what expectations can do to people. This story is from a new radio show and podcast that Alix and Lulu are launching this week. It's called <i>Invisibilia</i>. It's about the invisible forces that shape human behavior, like beliefs and assumptions and emotions, which I know sounds a little abstract. But in execution, I have to say it is anything but.</p></div>  </div>

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:03.50">Alix used to work here at our program. Lulu worked at <i>Radiolab</i>, and their new show is sort of halfway between the two. A quick heads-up before they launch into this. As you may have noticed, their voices sound a lot alike.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:06:15.94">They are.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:06:16.33">Sorry. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:16.86">Yes, I know that is not news to the two of you at all. So stay with us. And Lulu, let's just jump right in. Where do you want to start?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:06:25.95">Well, I'll start with a question that I asked the rat scientist, the expectations guy, Bob Rosenthal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:06:31.54">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:06:32.41">Could my expectations make a blind person who literally has no eyeballs see?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:06:40.77">No way. The expectations will not make him see.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:06:44.20">How sure are you about that one?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Rosenthal</h4><p begin="00:06:46.42">Positive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:06:51.94">So I'm deep in the woods of Southern California with a man named Daniel Kish. We've been hiking for hours, climbing over tree stumps and along the edges of a steep ravine. And we're just sitting down in the dirt to take a break.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:05.81">Could we look at your eyes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:09.69">In terms of them being out?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:11.50">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:11.95">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:14.63">And then Daniel pulls down his lower eyelids--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:19.41">Let me just--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:20.18">--and removes his eyes. They're prosthetic, of course, and they clink a little bit as he hands them over to me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:30.80">That's so cool.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:07:31.93">Two of the most beautiful hazel-blue eyes I've ever seen in the palm of his hand.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:38.78">Can I hold them?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:39.60">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:40.07">OK. Is it OK if my hand--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:40.53">Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:41.97">Wow. They are so lifelike. Does it feel odd to not have them in?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:51.14">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:51.46">Oh, it does?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:52.26">Oh, yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:07:52.47">OK.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:07:53.60">Daniel's eyes had to be removed when he was just a toddler because of cancer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:07:57.70">Retinoblastoma, which is basically eye cancer.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:08:00.44">And yet he's the one who's led me on this hike deep into the woods. We get to forks in the road, and he knows they're there. He leads me across a footbridge that's maybe two and a half feet wide without slowing down.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:08:13.28">I think we've passed what I was looking for.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:08:16.01">And over and over, the path takes us right alongside the edge of a cliff. And Daniel gets within inches but always senses it. So how does he do it? Well, he's got a cane and a hiking stick. But mainly--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:08:30.40">[TONGUE CLICKING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:08:31.74">--he clicks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:08:32.98">You press the tongue on the roof of the mouth.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:08:36.54">Is it kind of like [TONGUE CLICKING]?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:08:38.79">You're creating a vacuum.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:08:40.45">Huh.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:41.23">He clicks with his tongue as a way of understanding where he is in space. This is basically what bats do. Echolocation, the scientists call it. It's like sonar. From the way those clicks bounce off of things in the environment, Daniel gets a sort of sonic representation of what's around him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:08:59.98">So here, [TONGUE CLICKING], I can sense trees poking up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:09:06.15">Now, Daniel just happened to intuitively invent this when he was a toddler. No one taught him or trained him. He just made it up. And since he's been doing it his whole life, he's now so good at it that he can tell all sorts of things about what's in front of him-- if there's a wall, if the vegetation is dense or sparse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:09:25.95">So here's a bench.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:09:27.84">Yep.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:09:28.33">Garbage bins.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:09:29.45">Ding, ding, ding.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:09:30.70">Outhouse.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:09:31.99">Wow.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:09:33.39">And not only does this allow him to hike--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:09:35.72">So we'll go this way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:09:37.12">--navigate foreign cities alone, rock climb, horseback ride, but the one that gets all the attention is that he can ride a bicycle.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 1</h4><p begin="00:09:47.19">Meet Daniel Kish. He's blind, but that doesn't stop him from riding his bike.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:09:53.82">You may have heard of Daniel Kish before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 2</h4><p begin="00:09:55.75">Daniel Kish is completely blind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:09:57.98">He's usually called the Batman.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 3</h4><p begin="00:09:59.87">This real life Batman--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:10:01.58">Because he is the man who clicks, like a bat.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 4</h4><p begin="00:10:04.10">His remarkable, bat-like abilities.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:10:06.05">And he has made the media rounds to demonstrate what is usually described as his most amazing--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 5</h4><p begin="00:10:11.65">Extraordinary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 6</h4><p begin="00:10:12.16">Phenomenal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 7</h4><p begin="00:10:12.74">Remarkable.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:10:13.02">--nearly superhuman ability of being able to ride a bicycle even though he is blind.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>News Reporter 8</h4><p begin="00:10:20.23">As you watch him, remember, he can't see a thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:10:26.29">A narrative that Daniel thinks is all wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:10:30.32">(SINGING) Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee. Step right up! Step right up! The amazing Daniel Kish will demonstrate one of his greatest tricks to date.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:10:40.58">This is Daniel's buddy Brian Bushway, who has had to watch his poor friend wheel out the old bicycle so many times for the media that he couldn't help but mock the whole set up when I asked him to do it for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:10:50.43">And then he will proceed to mount himself on a bike and ride.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:10:56.11">And though Daniel indulged, pulling figure eights and riding beautifully as I ran beside him with my microphone, the two of them made it clear that my amazement was kind of offensive.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:11:07.95">So step right up, step right up, and see the amazing Daniel Kish do something that everybody can, but most people don't.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:11:19.53">And here's where we get back to expectations. See, Daniel thinks there is nothing amazing about him. He thinks that most blind people who don't have other disabilities could do things like ride bikes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:11:32.14">I definitely think that most blind people could move around with fluidity and confidence if that were the expectation.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:11:41.40">See, he thinks the reason that more blind people don't isn't just because they haven't learned to click. But it's because the expectations that you or I are carrying around in our own heads about what blind people can do are simply way too low.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:11:55.44">They wouldn't be able to hike. They wouldn't be able to run. They wouldn't be able to engage in manual labor.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:12:02.26">Daniel, like Bob, thinks those expectations, those private thoughts in our heads, are extremely powerful things, because over time, they have the ability to change the blind person we are thinking about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:12:14.85">That psychology becomes inculcated in the blind person, absorbed and translated into physical reality.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:12:23.94">And so Daniel thinks if we could all change our expectations of what blind people are capable of, then not only would you see a lot more blind people on bikes, but--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:12:33.75">More blind people could--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:12:35.62">--in a very real way--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:12:37.11">--see.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:12:38.23">Yeah, he just said "see."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:12:40.15">It's actually pretty simple and straightforward.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:12:43.29">And it turns out neuroscientists are looking into this idea and seeing some pretty shocking results. And we'll get there. But first, to understand what Daniel means, how expectations could give a blind person vision, we need to first see how Daniel himself shot through this forcefield of low expectations, a story which starts back in 1967, when Daniel was 13 months old, and that second eyeball had just been removed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:13:09.45">Oh, my gosh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:13:11.28">This is Danielle's mother, Paulette Kish. And a few days after taking her son home from the hospital, Paulette realized she was facing a really difficult choice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:13:20.91">My mom thought that I should put him in cotton.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:13:25.79">Cotton?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:13:26.48">Wrap him in cotton so that he didn't get hurt, so that he was so protected. That's really how she felt.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:13:33.05">See, Daniel was a very rambunctious little guy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:13:35.76">He started climbing when he was six months old, before he even walked.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:13:39.52">And that didn't change when he went blind.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:13:41.33">We had bookshelves he would climb, so I'd have to move everything off the bookshelves, because he would get into them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:13:46.19">So Paulette needed to decide, was her mom right? Was it time to start putting some restrictions on him, or was she going to raise him like a seeing child, allow him to explore his world with very few restrictions on him for blindness? And Paulette went with option two. She was going to banish her fear.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:14:04.23">Just put it away.

Daniel reads this book, and he starts thinking about Adam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam Shaible</h4><p begin="00:28:07.96">If I got lost, I used to get terrified.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:28:10.64">You know, maybe it wasn't that Adam was this weirdo, tentative kid but that he was a very typical product of a system.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:28:18.96">You mean, like, the system taught Adam that he would have trouble moving around.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:28:24.42">Yeah. I mean, he was led around school. People brought him his food--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Adam Shaible</h4><p begin="00:28:29.39">I don't know why people did things for me. They just did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:28:32.45">And when Daniel looked at the world around him, he thought, you know, a lot has changed. But a lot is frighteningly similar.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:28:39.15">From then till today, things are similar?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:28:40.86">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:28:41.45">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:28:41.83">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:28:42.63">I called around to over a dozen blindness organizations all over the country.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Norris</h4><p begin="00:28:46.74">My name is Daniel Norris, supervisor of adult services for the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:28:51.79">And supervisor after supervisor told me that what Bob Scott saw is still very much alive today.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:28:58.36">In what way?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:28:59.37">So most children who are blind in America don't actually go to schools for the blind anymore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Norris</h4><p begin="00:29:04.16">Right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:29:04.75">Thanks to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, most blind kids stay in their local public schools, which is great. But on those public school grounds, says Norris--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Norris</h4><p begin="00:29:16.81">There is a lot of pressure to keep a child safe, especially in a litigious society.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:29:22.10">So many of the blind students are still placed with a paraeducator, which can be good. But sometimes--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Norris</h4><p begin="00:29:28.82">Those paraeducators can end up doing the work for the kids.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:29:34.17">Like Adam.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Norris</h4><p begin="00:29:35.12">When you lighten someone's load, you don't allow them to expand.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:29:39.43">I talked to mothers whose blind kids were pulled off of playground equipment. And perhaps the most chilling thing is the fact that most blind kids will intuitively start clicking--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:29:49.71">[TONGUE CLICKING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:29:50.53">--or snapping or stamping to test out their environment with sound. But they are so often discouraged--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:29:56.41">It's not socially acceptable, is what they would say.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:29:58.85">--that they never get the chance to develop their skill to the level Daniel did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Norris</h4><p begin="00:30:04.36">So how are we doing as a nation? We have not taught independence.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:30:09.66">He points out that in America, a majority of blind people are unemployed. And while that could be for a lot of reasons, Norris thinks that's on us.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:30:19.31">What we are doing is we are creating slaves to others' thinking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:30:25.65">That's Daniel Kish again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:30:27.28">Slaves to others' perception, slaves to what others think they should be doing. And somehow we're comfortable with that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:30:36.70">And so, though he had never wanted to work in the profession of blindness-- in fact, he'd wanted to get as far away from it as he could-- Daniel Kish decided he sort of had no choice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:30:48.72">It sucked me in kind of kicking and screaming.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:30:50.92">He could see what was happening. And he held in his tongue, [TONGUE CLICKING], a way out. So he decided that he would dedicate his life to trying to liberate blind children.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:31:04.52">Kind of like Batman?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:31:05.57">Exactamundo, fighting for good in the world in a kind of vigilante way, because actually, the way that you go about liberating a blind child from the constraining forces of culture, it can get kind of ugly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:28.54">Coming up, the Dark Knight rises.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:31:39.91">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, we have a story from a brand new radio show and podcast called <i>Invisibilia</i>. It's from NPR News. Science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller are the hosts. And they're here today talking about how profoundly other people's expectations can affect us and about a blind man named Daniel Kish. Anyway, again, here's Alix.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:31:59.89">So when last we met Daniel, he had decided that he was going to become a kind of real-life Batman who would save people who were blind from the low expectations of their culture. But before we keep going, I should probably point out that lots of blind people don't necessarily want him as their savior. A bunch of them told us, basically, clicks shmicks!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Ringwald</h4><p begin="00:32:23.31">Because I get along just fine without doing that clicking noise, or whatever he calls it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:32:31.75">This is Bob Ringwald, a musician in California. He says he's got a cane. It works great. He does everything he wants.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Ringwald</h4><p begin="00:32:39.14">When I wanted to learn guitar, I did, and I've done a lot of climbing around on my roof and climbing up poles. And anything I wanted to do, I did.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:32:50.21">Now, Bob Ringwald-- in fact, all of the blind people that we spoke to for this story-- agreed with Daniel that low expectations hold blind people back. But that didn't necessarily mean that they wanted to echolocate. For example, when Bob Ringwald was seven, in school for the blind back in the '50s, he knew some kids who clicked and said they just seemed a little weird.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Ringwald</h4><p begin="00:33:12.93">I really didn't want to go through life clicking all the time. A lot of people think blind people are strange. So I didn't want to be any stranger than I already was.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Woods</h4><p begin="00:33:28.88">A lot of instructors don't like people to do that, because it does look funny.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:33:34.17">Eric Woods is also blind, and a retired mobility instructor in Colorado.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Eric Woods</h4><p begin="00:33:38.33">And it's socially unacceptable-- not unacceptable, but it's socially different. And so it has been discouraged. I've heard plenty of people discourage it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:33:47.81">And Daniel knew this. He knew what he was up against. So Lulu, what did Daniel do?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:33:52.76">Well, he starts up a nonprofit, as you do-- a nonprofit that will teach people how to echolocate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voice On Video</h4><p begin="00:34:00.30">Grace.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:34:01.28">This is one of his early instructional videos. It's now 2001, and since his aim is nothing short of liberation, he calls it World Access for the Blind.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Voice On Video</h4><p begin="00:34:13.64">World Access for the Blind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:34:17.28">Now, the only little problem that he runs into is that at that time, a blind person teaching another blind person how to get around is basically unheard of.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:34:27.45">The blind cannot lead the blind is right out of the Bible. It's fundamental to our culture.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:34:34.76">In fact, until the mid '90s--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:34:36.46">There was no certification for blind people to train other blind people.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:34:40.05">Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Scott</h4><p begin="00:34:40.77">Blind people can't do those things.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:34:43.45">So this is actually when the bike trick became big-- like, though he sort of hates "Look at the blind man ride a bike," he realized that could get him attention. So he starts going on all these TV shows with his trick.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:34:57.09">And my segment was between something about vampires and some other thing about faith healing or whatever.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:35:03.03">And on these TV appearances, he'd try to send some sort of signal to blind kids who might be watching, who might be able to contact him.</p><p begin="00:35:11.86">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tv Host</h4><p begin="00:35:13.71">Dan, can anyone learn this?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:35:15.81">Echolocation is a skill-- piano playing, for example. Some people may be more talented than others, but I think that anyone could learn it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:35:25.93">And it worked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:35:28.46">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:35:28.86">Slowly but surely, families started contacting him, which meant that Daniel was now faced with a question. Could he actually undo the damage of low expectations? And this is where things begin to get a little morally complicated.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:35:44.76">The example I'm about to give is an example that took place about 10 years ago.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:35:49.13">Daniel told me about going out to teach one of his first students ever, a little 10-year-old boy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:35:53.80">He lives on an apple orchard--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:35:54.95">Out in Washington state.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:35:56.41">I come out. And basically, what I see is a boy who won't leave his house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:36:01.73">And so Daniel's idea was to get him to climb a tree.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:36:04.21">They live on an orchard full of trees, for goodness' sakes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:36:06.48">But the kid won't budge. So to get him out the door, Daniel takes away all his toys.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:36:13.79">Our purpose was to kind of simulate the world that he was choosing for himself. So this is what life will have in store for you-- basically nothing, OK? Nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:36:26.41">And after about a week, the kid finally agrees to go climb a frickin' tree. And he gets up onto the first branch and the second branch and then says, OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:36:39.21">I give up. I give up. Yeah, but you know what? Giving up isn't an option. You can decide never to climb a tree for the rest of your life, but we are going to climb this one. And I said, you can go up, you cannot go down. And he just had a fit-- literally screaming himself hoarse. I mean, he actually jumped at one point. Like, he actually leapt off the tree, he was in such a frenzy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:37:05.89">Oh my god, Lulu. And what does Daniel do?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:37:08.76">Well, he catches him. He's right below him. And he just says, no.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:37:11.95">You can go up. You cannot go down.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:37:14.99">And they stay in this tree battling it out.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:37:17.93">Inch by inch by-- it took three hours to get up a 60-foot tree.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:37:22.72">But by the end, the kid was doing it himself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:37:25.92">--doing it himself. He started finding his own footholds, finding his own handholds.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:37:30.66">And Daniel thinks this training and how the parents then took it on too changed the boy's life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:37:37.06">By the age of 13, he was out of his shell. He had joined Boy Scouts. That is in no way where he was headed.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:37:45.97">Hm. That is just crazy, though, that story, on some level. I don't know if that kind of bullying is even allowed in America anymore, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:37:57.98">Yeah. And most schools for the blind have been reluctant to hire him because of liability issues. They're scared it'll be too dangerous for their students.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:38:06.57">I bet.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:38:07.40">But see, Daniel would say that attitude, Alix, is part of the problem. So what are a few tears, huh, a few scratches? He has this line he always says.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:38:18.49">Running into a pole is a drag. But never being allowed to run into a pole is a disaster.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:38:26.81">He worries that when you prevent a kid from, say, running into a pole, what you end up preventing them from is the kind of experience that allow for-- and this gets me back to that crazy sounding claim he made at the beginning of the show-- actual sight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:38:44.81">If our culture recognized the capacity of blind people to see, then more blind people would learn to see. It's actually pretty simple and straightforward.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:38:54.94">Daniel thinks this because, well, he says he sees.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:38:58.73">I definitely would say that I experience images, that I have images.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:39:03.20">And he isn't talking metaphorically here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:39:05.10">They are images of spatial character and depth that have a lot of the same qualities that a person who sees would see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:39:16.93">Hello?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:39:17.76">Hi.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:39:18.56">Hi.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:39:19.74">This is Lore Thaler, a German neuroscientist at Durham University in the UK. And Lore knows a lot about sight. She studies vision in the brain-- literally how the images we see are constructed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:39:33.19">It sounds simple, but an image is actually a complex construct.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:39:37.86">Several years ago, Lore happened across a video of Daniel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:39:41.18">OK, so we had a little string of parked vehicles there--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:39:43.60">And as she watched the way that he so easily moved through space, she found herself wondering, was there any way that Daniel's brain was indeed constructing images?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:39:54.19">It was so akin to vision, really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:39:58.96">OK, so you may know this already, but Lore reminded me that an image, even though it feels like it's out there in the world in front of your eyes actually exists behind the eyes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:40:09.61">The image, it's something that your mind constructs.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:40:13.84">In a part of your brain called the visual cortex. So Lore brought Daniel and a few other people who can echolocate into her lab, and she took recordings of them while they clicked at different objects in space.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:40:25.51">[TONGUE CLICKING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:40:26.29">A car, a lamppost-- these are her actual recordings-- a salad bowl, a salad bowl in motion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:40:34.78">How do you get a salad bowl in motion?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:40:36.73">You stand behind the person with a salad bowl on a fishing pole, and you slowly wave it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:40:42.74">Right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:40:43.57">And the microphones were actually in their ears.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:40:45.96">So we recorded what they heard exactly.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:40:49.66">Oh, that's neat.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:40:50.50">And then she played the recordings back to them, one object at a time, while they were lying down in fMRI machines, so she could watch how their brains responded. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl in motion.</p><p begin="00:41:01.86">And then in a second study, she compared those readings to what happens in the brains of sighted people looking at the same kinds of things. Salad bowl. Salad bowl in motion.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:41:12.06">Very clever, very clever.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:41:13.39">Yep. And what she found is that even though for decades scientists assumed that the visual cortex goes dark when you are blind, Daniel's was lighting up like a disco ball.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:41:27.34">Yeah, so that was really very impressive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:41:30.88">And the way in which it was lighting up-- this is really cool. So it turns out that there are all these different parts of the brain involved in vision. So there's an area that's specifically dedicated to processing motion, and that's way over here behind the ears. And then there's a completely different area for texture--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:41:46.96">Lightness, so how bright is something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:41:49.06">--orientation, shape. And in Daniel's brain, many of these areas were lighting up. Color and brightness, no action there. But motion, when they did that salad bowl in motion test, the motion area behind the ears started pumping with blood flow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:42:06.51">Very vigorously.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:42:08.28">And orientation-- turns out there's sort of a grid for orientation in the brain. And she could watch as the salad bowl moved across those quadrants.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lore Thaler</h4><p begin="00:42:19.16">It was really robust, highly significant.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:42:25.15">All right, Miss Spiegel. So I know that sometimes neurology and neuroscience--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:42:30.21">Goes over my head?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:42:31.93">Or just sounds like a foreign language that you're not particularly interested in speaking.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:42:37.30">Uh-huh. Just land the plane for me. What does this mean?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:42:41.39">What this work suggests is that you may not actually need eyes to see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:42:51.76">I kind of feel like we've got to shout it from the rooftops. Come on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:42:58.72">Oh my god.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:43:00.56">OK. You might not need eyes to see!</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:43:05.51">Now, Lore is by no means the only person seeing this result. The idea first started coming up in the mid '90s, when a lab at Harvard saw that visual areas of the brain can be activated by sound and touch.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:43:16.34">Do I have to do it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:43:18.05">Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:43:18.16">You might not need eyes to see!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:43:20.92">And since then, dozens of labs have been looking into just how nuanced and rich that visual imagery may be. So there's a guy at Berkeley, Santani Teng, who's been trying to determine the acuity of these images. You know, like an eye test-- how close to 20/20 are they?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:43:37.76">Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:43:38.30">And what he's found is that their 75% localization thresholds indicated spatial acuity as fine as 1.5 degrees of the subtended angle.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:43:47.39">No!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:43:48.00">It's true! I'll put it another way. He thinks their world looks a lot like your peripheral vision. So imagine that you're texting on your cellphone walking down the street. OK, you're looking at that screen. Now, what does the street look like to you?</p><p begin="00:44:03.83">You know, you can see people coming at you. You can see cars. You can see trees. But you couldn't read a sign.

You know, is what they're experiencing comparable?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:44:37.23">Yeah, oh yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:44:38.80">This is Brian Bushway, who you met briefly at the top of the show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:44:41.73">So step right up!</p><p begin="00:44:43.29">I became totally blind at the age of 14.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:44:46.34">But once he learned echolocation--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:44:48.05">Just [SNAP] like that!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:44:49.08">--the world around him, although blurrier and colorless, appeared again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:44:55.06">Things are real. I mean, it's as real as looking at it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Alix Spiegel</h4><p begin="00:44:58.86">Wait, wait, wait. So Lulu, does every blind person have this?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:45:03.16">No. And that's the thing-- Lore has looked at the brains of people who do not echolocate, and though there's definitely some activity in the visual cortex, it's simply not as active. Which brings me back to Daniel's teaching methods. The thing about echolocation is, yes, you can learn it when you get older. But it gets so much harder with age, which is why Daniel doesn't give a damn about making a little kid cry, because he thinks at the other end of those tears is sight.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:45:34.90">OK, off we go.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:45:37.00">So I finally got to see one of these training sessions in action. We went to see a five-year-old boy named Nathan Nip.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:45:42.88">OK, so what we'll do then is we'll ask Nathan's mom about parks or some place that he doesn't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:45:49.25">Brian's with us too, actually. He's now one of Daniel's deputy teachers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:45:52.83">He can click.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:45:55.04">And part of the goal that day was to get Nathan out of his comfort zone. But the bigger part-- and really, what is often this other major part of what Daniel is trying to teach-- is to get the people around Nathan to back off.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:46:10.03">Hello?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Godmother</h4><p begin="00:46:10.50">Hi!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:46:10.82">So we go into the house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nathan Nip</h4><p begin="00:46:13.43">I am five and a half, and Ashton's two.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:46:15.47">Daniel asks to hear Nathan's clicks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nathan Nip</h4><p begin="00:46:17.35">[TONGUE CLICKING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Kish</h4><p begin="00:46:18.16">You have a nice smiley click.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:46:20.07">And then we head out to a faraway park.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:46:23.53">Where are we?

Nathan?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:46:35.54">And the idea is to make Nathan find his way around this park by himself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:46:38.95">So we want to use our, [TONGUE CLICKING], our clicks. And we're going to explore what's around here in this park.

Listen into the distance.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:47:48.72">And he's getting closer and closer to the edge of the road.

And that just keeps happening over and over again, and I think so many blind people's lives, they never get that moment of what it is to really have that self-confidence to trust your senses to know, oh, if I do use my cane properly and I am listening attentively to information around me, I'll be OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:48:54.05">I think part of the problem is that when we have eyes, we can see things coming from further away. The whole point is, like, when it's your cane and you're clicking, you catch edges at what appears like the last moment.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Brian Bushway</h4><p begin="00:49:07.91">We don't need to go any farther.

Um, no.

He wonders if it could have been the surgeries he had as a tiny boy or from the way his parents raised him.

Because unlike the rest of us, when those arms reached out for him, he never once had any desire to fall back into them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:53:53.70">Everything that happens in your life has its effect.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:53:57.12">That's his mom again, Paulette.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paulette Kish</h4><p begin="00:53:58.55">Has its effect.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Lulu Miller</h4><p begin="00:54:00.62">And you don't think it's that Daniel became this way because he was in some way neglected or because it was too hard?
