  <h3>Prologue.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.28">We've been doing a lot of stories lately on the radio show about police. And they've been pretty heavy, we know. This is not a story like that. In fact, kind of the opposite.</p><p begin="00:00:10.67">When Miles and Katie's apartment was robbed, they knew this was not going to be a big case. And if you got right down to it, they  did not have a problem with that. New York City cops arrived after the burglary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:00:20.65">They had probably just come from some sort of situation where someone had gotten stabbed in the neck. And now they were in these yuppies' apartment. And we were running down this laundry list of things that had been stolen. And--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:30.99">And the list is like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:00:32.12">Ugh, it's so embarrassing. It's an iPad, an iPod, an Xbox.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:39.06">They've got bigger problems.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:00:39.86">Yeah, they got bigger fish to fry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:41.94">Surveillance video from the building showed that the culprits were three teenagers who took the elevator to the top floor, probably jumped down onto a balcony and then walked into Katie's and Miles' apartment through a sliding glass door. Then there's video of them leaving the building.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:00:56.85">Three teenage guys with three of our backpacks stuffed full.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:00.41">Oh, so they're using your backpacks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:02.09">Our own backpacks. [CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:02.99">So they didn't even have any plans how they're going to carry this out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:05.54">I guess not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:01:06.63">It didn't seem like a very well thought out caper. This was more of a let's break into this building and see if someone's dumb enough to leave their sliding glass door open.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:14.01">Of all the things they lost, the only thing that they actually cared about was their video camera. And they only cared about that because it had their wedding video on it-- the only copy. Katie filmed the wedding to show her brother, but hadn't yet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:25.21">My brother, who I'm really close to, couldn't come to the wedding. And so it was really sentimental, and I really wanted it back. And I was really upset. I was really, really sad about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:34.98">So, the morning after the burglary, knowing that the police were not going to be much help on this one, Katie decides to jump into action herself. She goes onto Craigslist to see if the thieves have put her camera up for sale there. And boom, she finds it immediately-- same camera, in the same bag, with all the accessories that she  had specially bought for the camera, had to be hers. And she calls the detectives on the case, tells them the good news.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:01:57.60">I can get my camera, and I can probably put these guys in jail. And he just immediately shoots me down and says, there's no way of really knowing if that's your camera. We can't help you with anything. The only way we'd be able to help you is if you got the guy to give you a serial number off the camera, and if you happen to still have the serial number from the camera, and they match. And I think he was just thinking that'll never happen.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:27.13">Katie, however, saves all her warranties in a special folder. She does have the serial number. And to confirm that it's the same as the advertised camera, she calls the guy on Craigslist, and she concocts this story that she is a girl who needs to buy the camera for a school project.</p><p begin="00:02:43.66">She puts on this supposedly tough sounding Brooklyn accent that I would describe as the Brooklyn accent you would hear performed by a kid actor on the Disney Channel. I made her do this for me. You do not want to hear it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:02:55.17">And I had told him that my boyfriend was going to kick my ass if I spent our last $300 buying a camera that broke the next day. And so, do you have the warranty for the camera? And he said, no, he was like, uh, I got this camera from my friend. So, there was no warranty with it.</p><p begin="00:03:13.11">And I was like, OK, well, do you know, is there a way to find out if it's still under warranty? And he said, well, I think you can find out if the camera's under warranty if you go online.</p><p begin="00:03:23.18">And I was like, OK, well what do I need to do? And he was like, well, I think you need to have the serial number.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:30.12">So you didn't actually just ask him for the serial number. You wanted him to suggest the serial number?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:03:34.19">Yeah. Because I thought if I asked him for the serial number, then he would know right away what I was trying to do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:39.22">Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:03:39.65">So I was trying to get him to say it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:42.33">She asked him, can you read me the serial number? And he says he doesn't have the camera with him. He'll have to call her back. And she figures, oh, that's it, the jig is up. He knows she's lying. He will never call back.</p><p begin="00:03:52.70">As Miles points out, this story that she has made up, it really makes no sense at all. OK, she's got a sociopath boyfriend--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:03:59.30">--who had beat up his girlfriend over the very nerdy error of buying a video camera that wasn't under warranty.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:06.77">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:04:07.32">[LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:04:07.72">It wasn't like he was drunk, and he found her cheating on him, or anything. He was like, he's violent enough to beat somebody up. But only if they buy a video camera that we don't have a warranty for.</p><p begin="00:04:18.37">Because god forbid, something should happen, and this camera breaks down. We can't get our money back. We can't get it repaired. You know what's going to happen. It's like, what?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:34.54">And then the guy calls back, gives her the serial number. Of course, it matches. Katie calls the detective to let him know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:04:42.90">He says, oh really? Well, what should we do? [CHUCKLES] And I was like, you tell me what we should do. You're the detective.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:53.60">And he says, of course, we'll do a sting. Call the guy and arrange to buy the camera from him. Set a location. We'll be there too. We'll swoop in. We'll nab him.</p><p begin="00:05:03.54">15 minutes later, the police arrive to take Katie and Miles to the sting. Katie runs downstairs to meet the detective on the street.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:10.22">He tells me that there's been a change of plans. He doesn't need my husband to come anymore. He only needs me. I'm not going to meet the burglar face-to-face anymore because it's not safe. And so, he's got a different plan of how we're going to do this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:26.24">At that point, Miles arrives downstairs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:28.35">I turn around to him, and I just say, change of plans. They don't need us both anymore. They just need me. It's not safe for you to go. I'll call you when it's over.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:41.23">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:44.01">(LAUGHING) And he's stunned.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:47.03">(LAUGHING) Because that's not alarming at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:05:48.84">(LAUGHING) Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:51.52">Miles watches her get into the car and drive off. Inside the car, Katie says, the detectives tell her the new plan. She's going to stay in the car and talk to the guy on the cellphone, keep him talking, as the cops go and grab them, though they are very skeptical.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:06:04.35">Basically, saying, the chance of this working out is so small. This is never going to happen. Don't get your panties in a bunch.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:12.50">She and the Craigslist guy agree to meet at a CVS drugstore. Cops go inside. And then on the cellphone, Katie asks  him, OK, what are you wearing? So she can recognize him. She tells him, OK, I'm in the makeup aisle.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Katie</h4><p begin="00:06:23.43">I'm like, oh, I'm by the Cover Girl makeup. He starts walking down the aisle, I guess. And he says, I still don't see you. And at that point, I hear "Hands up! You're under arrest."</p><p begin="00:06:35.06">And the same detectives who were brushing me off the entire ride out there, then are walking over to the car with the video camera in hand, high-fiving each other. And I hear them say, that was some real police work. Great detective work!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:49.78">The police could not be more surprised to be making this arrest. And, to be fair, as Miles points out, it's crazy that it worked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:06:57.01">There are so many different stages where the criminal should have bailed out, like the fact she comes up with a story about I need the warranty. He calls her back. He makes the effort to call her back and said, didn't you need a serial number for the warranty? It's like, what? I can't believe that he's playing along with it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:16.23">Honestly, you don't get that level of service from real stores.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:07:19.17">[LAUGHS] You don't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:21.72">See, but that's the whole thing, is that she's an amateur sleuth, but he's also an amateur criminal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:07:26.59">Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:26.85">And this is the moment where they meet up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miles</h4><p begin="00:07:28.42">Right. So there'd be no way a detective would ever spend the amount of time that it would take to concoct this ruse to go after this camera.

  <h3>Act One. Theater of War.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:08:35.93">Back when the first President Bush was in office, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. And for the first time since Vietnam, really, America returned to the battlefield. Derrick Brown felt called. And so he wound up at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, one of the largest military bases in the world, back then, about 40,000 soldiers, most famously, the 82nd Airborne and other Ready Units that can be deployed in 18 hours.</p><p begin="00:09:00.54">Fort Bragg is America's waiting room for war. When Derrick first arrived, he was trained as a paratrooper.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:09:06.67">You'd wake up at 5:00 in the morning. Then you would deploy out to the field. You'd do a jump from 800 feet. I was an artillery man, so they'd throw the tanks out of the planes. Then they'd throw us out of the planes.</p><p begin="00:09:20.97">So you'd do these mock war exercises, where people would try and attack you and kill you. And you'd be out in the cold. And you'd be digging more foxholes and just seeing how ground down you could possibly be so that when the time comes for war, your body and mind have been pushed as far as possible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:09:39.79">Every once in a while, there'd be something else-- a volunteer duty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:09:43.43">I remember the captain of our unit. He said he had this strange detail, which was we had to mandatorily send one soldier from our battery to be a part of this musical. And it would last several weeks. You wouldn't have to do any field duty, but you would have to sing and dance. And everyone thought he was joking.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:10:09.25">[CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:10:09.70">And I raised my hand.

And they had me sit in this room. And this director first had everyone audition. And he asked me if I knew of any songs that I could sing, any from any musicals. And I said, not at all. [CHUCKLES]</p><p begin="00:10:39.47">I had never sang or danced in my life, except while running and singing cadences and Jody calls in the military. And he said, well, just sing me something. And I remember singing "Even Flow," by Pearl Jam.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:10:53.25">Can you give me a couple of lines?

And it turns out that no one was turned away.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:11:19.69">In rehearsals, Derrick quickly got a sense that something different was going on here. This was not just your average musical revue.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:11:26.53">What kind of dancing are you doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:11:29.42">It's march dancing. I don't know if you've seen it. But it is the director's idea to combine the honor and discipline of military movements with the bravado and panache of Broadway movements.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:11:52.81">But the thing Derrick remembers most, more than 20 years later, was not the song and dance numbers. It was the stuff in between. They were short films projected on a screen above the performers. And they were the opposite of lighthearted entertainment, grim testimonials about soldiers who'd died, not in combat, but drunk driving and in other accidents near the base, all done in a dark bluntness one rarely sees outside Drivers Ed movies.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Derrick Brown</h4><p begin="00:12:19.78">It would go from show tune to a video on the screen of a fellow soldier that they interviewed talking about how one of their fellow soldiers, their friend, died. And then, uh-oh, surprise, we would sing a show tune. And it was this progression of dance, sad video, sing a bit, sad video. And then some guys come rappelling out of the ceiling for the closing number at the end of the hour for the final chance to cheer everyone up, so they'd leave feeling inspired. It was insane.</p><p begin="00:12:57.24">We would have discussions backstage, which is what the-- what are we doing? Why are we doing this? How did this thing even come to be?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:13:09.82">Excellent questions. How did one of the most straight-laced, no-nonsense institutions in the entire country, the US Army, end up producing this piece of Dada musical theater? I wanted answers, so I went straight up the chain of command.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>General Carl Stiner</h4><p begin="00:13:25.75">Yes, I'm General Carl Stiner, US Army, retired. And I was the Commander of 82nd Airborne Division during 1987 and 1988.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:13:35.96">General Stiner was at Fort Bragg. And he confirmed that, yes, for a while in the '70s, '80s, and early '90s, there was this annual show which the entire base was required to attend. So there were three or four performances a day for a week or so, during the Christmas season, which is when accidental deaths spiked.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>General Carl Stiner</h4><p begin="00:13:53.25">We realized that we were having more casualties from all off duty activities, mainly motorcycles, than from thousands of parachute jumps and heavy equipment drops to where we just needed to do something about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:14:11.65">Stiner told me that, some years, for every death of a soldier during training exercises, there were almost 10 killed getting drunk and driving crazy. Wartime deaths, we all know about and after-war PTSD. But this was a whole other kind of statistic-- pre-combat deaths, which comes when tens of thousands of teenagers anxiously awaiting war get pumped up jumping out of planes and firing heavy artillery. How could some beer, and say, a motorcycle possibly affect them?</p><p begin="00:14:42.94">Originally, the base had ordered mandatory safety lectures, but the soldiers just slept through them. So the United States Defense Department, the greatest fighting force ever to march on the planet, decided they would try show tunes. And that's the origin of what came to be called <i>The</i> <i>Soldier</i> <i>Safety</i> <i>Show.</i></p><p begin="00:15:03.09">I interviewed a dozen veterans from this era, and they all remember the weird mash-up of gut-wrenching testimonials and cheery eye-high leg kicks. They all said, you had to see it to believe it, and I wanted to believe it.</p><p begin="00:15:17.66">When I called Stiner, he told me that he had a videotape of one of the shows.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>General Carl Stiner</h4><p begin="00:15:21.89">I had a VCR of it. But age caused the thing to just self-destruct. You couldn't even tell what it was, the pictures, and so on. And so, we struck out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:15:35.92">I won't bore you with the details, but finding a videotape literally took months. The public school library had a set of <i>Soldier</i> <i>Safety</i> <i>Shows.</i> But not long before I called, they went full-on digital and junked all their old-school audio-visual stuff.</p><p begin="00:15:49.99">A Freedom of Information request came up completely dry. Finally, I happened upon Gudron Blackmon, still working at Bragg, who called back to say she had an old box at home and it, a tape. The label read, "1989 Soldier Safety Show-- Life is Worth Living."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Folk Guitarist</h4><p begin="00:16:08.75">(SINGING) This road of life we travel, it can take us many ways.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:16:14.75">Early on, we see a folk guitarist seated onstage, plucking out a sad melody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Folk Guitarist</h4><p begin="00:16:19.36">(SINGING)  But for all of these young soldiers, whose lives had just begun--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:16:25.11">Above him on a screen is a general.

It's a tribute to everyone who fought in World War II.</p><p begin="00:17:45.57">[MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:17:48.56">And these absurd smash-ups just keep happening for the rest of the show, just like all the soldiers told me.

His name was Lee Yopp. And his journey to theater was not one anyone might predict.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bo Thorp</h4><p begin="00:18:08.48">He had no personal taste.

I wrote a book about amateurs a few years ago, those dreamers in their garages, fiddling, creating, struggling. What keeps most of them stuck in the garage is lack of funders. Lee Yopp had hundreds of millions of funders, the taxpayers of the United States.</p><p begin="00:23:21.55">Everybody I talk to, especially the cast and crew that were in so many of these shows-- the regulars-- all mentioned this one time, one moment that stood out for them. It was 1982. There'd been a terrible car accident, this time, involving one of the cast member's kids. Here's actress Bo Thorp.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bo Thorp</h4><p begin="00:23:39.50">My son was nearly killed. I mean, he was coming home from his first football game.

And when she went to put on the brakes, the car went into a skid and then hit a tree. And so, he was in a body cast for six months.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Jack Hitt</h4><p begin="00:24:13.72">She says everyone in the show was heartbroken, of course, including Yopp. But Yopp, being Yopp, saw an opportunity.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bo Thorp</h4><p begin="00:24:20.44">He said, ah, you know what we can do?

  <h3>Act Two. And Baby Makes 0011. </h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:30:18.93">The first time I saw a robotic baby was at my local pharmacy. It was one of those old-timey places with a candy counter and surgical supplies and a large selection of scented candles.</p><p begin="00:30:29.98">One day, I was in the store. And I heard this teenage girl behind me say, "My god, this baby is so heavy." She had a car seat slung over her shoulder like a purse. And for a second, I thought the plastic baby inside it was real. "The real ones are heavier," I told her. She groaned and whipped the car seat over to her other shoulder.</p><p begin="00:30:49.86">At the time, I had a three-year-old, and I was dying to know if this girl's experience with the plastic baby was anything remotely like my experience with my flesh and blood baby. The girl told me she went to Glen Ridge High. Glen Ridge is the town next to mine in New Jersey. So I called the school and asked if they'd let me hang out the next time the kids got the babies.</p><p begin="00:31:09.54">[BABY CRYING]</p><p begin="00:31:11.90"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:31:13.59">Oh, and don't forget to support her neck when you pick her up out of the car seat. OK?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:31:18.59">Ms. Hogan, the health teacher, is setting up two girls with their babies. The robot babies are so expensive that the school only has 10 of them. So the students take turns with them for two solid days of pretend parenting. In the class I visited, the students on deck were Rachel--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:31:34.22">Let's kick it. I'm excited.

Rachel and Paige are friends. But they're about as different as two 17-year-olds can be. We'll start with Paige.</p><p begin="00:31:54.60">Paige is brimming with maternal affection for her fake baby. She pulls a flowered onesie out of her book bag and  shows it to Joanna.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:32:02.10">I brought clothes for her.</p><p begin="00:32:03.50">[GUSHES]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna</h4><p begin="00:32:04.54">Wait, are these your baby clothes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:32:06.11">Well, I think some of them are. My mom saved them, and then I used them for when I used to play baby dolls.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:32:12.28">Just a note here about Paige's voice. I've never heard anyone talk like her before. She's not whispering or anything. This is just the way she sounds.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Joanna</h4><p begin="00:32:20.63">You're really going for the full immersion.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:32:22.87">I am. I am, because I was so excited to get a baby. So I know it'll be so much fun. It'll be hard, but it'll be fun.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:32:33.39">To be clear, there was no need to bring baby clothes. The doll comes with its own outfit.</p><p begin="00:32:39.37">Paige is a devout Christian. She wears a purity ring.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:32:42.54">And I made a promise that I will not ever give myself away before I'm married, because I think it's one of the worst mistakes somebody could do.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:32:53.06">So that's Paige. Now, here's Rachel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:32:56.06">I don't think that losing your virginity is giving yourself away. I think--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:32:59.66">Rachel is the quintessential theater kid. She describes herself as liberal and bisexual. She's never had sex with anyone, but she keeps a good luck condom in her drawer, just in case.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:33:10.55">It's just in my room. I know it's there. I went on a trip somewhere once by myself. And I just brought it, even though I knew I wouldn't use it. But it's just for good luck.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:33:20.27">Rachel thinks she wants to wait until her 30s to have kids. She did not bring in baby clothes today for her robot baby. She thinks this whole baby thing will just make for a fun story, like the time she joined the boys' wrestling team and wound up puking in the locker room.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:33:34.68">I've been more excited about the back story than anything else. I need to find who's the father. I need to figure it out. Was it left on my doorstep?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:33:42.74">The girls take their babies. Each is in a car seat. Each looks like a real baby, except plastic-- the huge speaker on its chest, a vacant stare. Their lips are always pursed for feeding. And somehow, they always look a little pissed off.</p><p begin="00:34:00.55">Paige and Rachel head to class, their first big challenge.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:34:03.82">Do you know how much blood you're giving?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:34:05.98">Today is the blood drive at Glen Ridge High.</p><p begin="00:34:08.51">[BABY CRYING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lab Tech</h4><p begin="00:34:08.96">Let me take my gloves off.</p><p begin="00:34:10.79">[BABY CRYING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:34:11.71">Rachel is laid out flat on a table with a tourniquet around her arm.

I want to take care of my baby. I don't like that sound.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:34:30.54">If those cries sound disturbingly real, it's because they're recordings of actual babies crying.</p><p begin="00:34:36.28">[BABY CRYING LOUDLY]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:34:38.66">Oh, the baby really wants me now.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:34:41.12">And if Rachel could get to her baby, here is how she would get it to stop crying. And it has to be her. It can't be someone else. She's being graded on this. So she's wearing a wristband that she swipes over the baby.</p><p begin="00:34:53.68">[BEEP]</p><p begin="00:34:54.75">That identifies her as the mother. Next, she'd have to figure out why the baby is crying. It could need one of four things, burping, rocking, diapering, or feeding. To feed it, you hold a fake bottle by the baby's lips. And if she's hungry, she goes like this.</p><p begin="00:35:11.86">[SUCKING]</p><p begin="00:35:15.03">When she's full, she goes like this.</p><p begin="00:35:17.47">[COOING]</p><p begin="00:35:18.78">You have only two minutes to get it right. If you don't, you lose points. If you don't support the baby's neck, more points off. So all the time Rachel's on the blood donor table, she's losing points. The lab tech holds Rachel's arm, pushes the needle into her vein.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:35:36.07">Ow, ow, ow, it really hurts now. It hurts more now. Ow, ow, ow, OK.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:35:42.14">And then, like any stressed out drama geek--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:35:44.68">(SINGING)</p><p begin="00:35:45.49">[BABY CRYING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:35:48.05">--Rachel bursts into song, opera.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:35:50.92">(SINGING)</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:35:54.62">Are you singing because of the pain or because you don't want to hear the  baby crying?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:35:57.96">It's a little bit of both, mostly because of the pain. I'm sorry, baby!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:36:02.66">Meanwhile, Paige's baby seems to need attention constantly. She'll feed it or rock it, and it'll stop crying, but then start up again four minutes later, then five minutes after that, then another seven minutes after that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:36:16.58">I think I've kind of learned already, and it's only an hour and a half into it. I've definitely learned this baby-- it's kind of like a normal baby, but not. Because I think a normal baby is not this needy.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:36:36.06">Of course, a human baby is way more needy, but you know, amateurs.</p><p begin="00:36:46.40">Joanna and I follow Paige and Rachel through the rest of their classes. The babies wail through lectures, through debates. In one class, there are four babies going off.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:36:56.49">This is the most "baby-full" class I've gone to, so far.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:36:59.40">Which makes it feel more like a nursery than a school.</p><p begin="00:37:01.69">[BABY CRYING]</p><p begin="00:37:04.51">While taking a test, Rachel discovers a clever workaround. She props the bottle up in the car seat, and basically, has the baby feed itself. Some teachers are amused. Others aren't.

Rachel, over and out.</p><p begin="00:40:23.70">[BABY CRYING LOUDLY]</p><p begin="00:40:27.04"/><p begin="00:40:28.47">[BEEP]</p><p begin="00:40:29.44">This is wake-up number two, about five minutes later. It seems like she doesn't really need anything. She's just lonely, I guess.</p><p begin="00:40:41.30">[BABY SOUNDS]</p><p begin="00:40:43.56">(SINGING) Oh, once I had a little doll. Its color, it was brown. I taught him for to whistle.</p><p begin="00:40:52.40">[BABY SOUNDS]</p><p begin="00:40:55.71">It is 4:13. The baby was hungry again.</p><p begin="00:41:04.11">The tiredeness is really setting in. I've grown strangely emotionally attached to this lump of plastic. And I'm going to be a tiny bit sad to get rid of her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:41:16.24">Rachel records herself every single time the baby wakes her up both nights, a total of nine times. Paige was so overwhelmed by the night wakings that she didn't wind up recording herself at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:41:27.72">I am so, so tired. And I don't know why, but I feel like my whole body has just been slammed up against a wall. I just-- I can barely keep my eyes open. And I just feel so exhausted.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:41:44.82">And how were you feeling while it was going on? Were you feeling mad at the baby?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:41:50.10">A little bit. (CRYING) I wasn't mad, just my mama came in and said, well, scan it, sweetheart. And I remember saying, I already did.</p><p begin="00:42:00.96">And then I took her diaper off, threw the diaper, put the diaper back on. And she still was crying. And I looked at my mom, and said, mom. And so, around the third time she woke up, I was--</p><p begin="00:42:13.67">[GROWLS]</p><p begin="00:42:15.42"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:42:19.94">I just wanted everyone to be quiet and leave me alone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:42:23.41">The next day at school, Rachel was not herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:42:26.18">Before chorus, Katie Schultz, who was actually, she plays the nun in the play, she just asked me, how's the baby? And I just went, can everyone just shut up! And in my mind, I was like, she wasn't doing anything. She was not the person I should be yelling at. But I was just like, ahh!</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:42:44.58">Overnight, Paige and Rachel have become animals I recognize intimately. They've become mothers, throwing their minds, bodies, and hearts so fully into a tiny being that they can't help but whine and lash out at people who don't deserve it.</p><p begin="00:42:59.71">Even Paige says she's become a jerk or her version of a jerk. She forgot to thank a boy who held the door for her. Plus, she admits to me that she's cheated a second time. She forgot to bring her costume for a dress rehearsal. So  she slipped the bracelet off again and left the baby with a friend while she ran home.</p><p begin="00:43:19.21">Next morning comes the moment of truth. The girls hand in their babies and get their grades. The robot baby keeps a minute by minute record of how you did. Paige goes first.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:43:29.57">Paige is a 71.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:43:31.21">71, which is what in letters?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:43:33.31">C-.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:43:34.62">And what did she get points deducted for?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:43:36.56">For she had a missed feeding, a head support. And then 6:49, she had a missed feeding and a head support. 6:58, she had a missed burp and 9:29, yeah, so.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:43:47.92">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:43:48.77">All right.</p><p begin="00:43:48.98">[CHUCKLES]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:43:49.26">It's all right. Don't worry. Don't fret.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:43:51.00">I  didn't want all that  to happen, because every time she cried, I picked her up immediately, gave her her bottle. If she didn't want that, I put her diaper on.</p><p begin="00:44:00.69">So I don't know. I thought I did OK. I didn't think I'd get a C. So, I'm a little disappointed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:44:10.08">Rach, let me get your grade for you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:44:13.88">The big moment for Rachel. She's getting her grade.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:44:16.55">Ahh!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:44:20.02">94.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:44:20.82">Which translates to an A?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ms. Hogan</h4><p begin="00:44:22.34">An A, yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:44:23.56">If I were a betting person, I'd have never put money on Rachel doing better than Paige, especially not this much better. For all of her baby clothes and maternal instinct, not to mention wanting to be a young mom, Paige turns out to be a below average mother, at least, when it comes to plastic children.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:44:41.63">Has this changed the way you feel about becoming a mother and about babies?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paige</h4><p begin="00:44:50.24">I thought I could have a baby at 21. I'll go to ministry school, meet a man of god, and a man of my dreams. We'll get married and have a baby. But I think maybe, I think-- maybe a little older than I thought. I cannot even imagine putting a baby, a life, into my world. And I think it'd be horrible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:45:28.28">Paige isn't sure how old she wants to be when she starts a family now. She just knows she can't even picture it. Her whole life plan has been thrown out of whack by her robot baby.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:45:38.12">My response to the baby was almost the opposite of Paige's in that, if I have a baby really young, I feel like I would keep the baby.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:45:47.20">I also never would have guessed that Paige and Rachel would flip their positions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rachel</h4><p begin="00:45:51.49">Because I kind of like the feeling of having a baby. For some reason, I guess the idea that someone or something needs you and only you makes you feel all important. [CHUCKLES] It was awful, but at the same time, I was-- I kind of liked it. I'd never really thought that I would want to have a kid younger, but maybe I would.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Hillary Frank</h4><p begin="00:46:16.53">Rachel called it "early onset baby fever" and said her mom was freaked out by it. I asked one of Rachel's teachers and the president of the company that makes the babies about this ironic and unintended outcome, that the robot baby made a teenage girl want to have a real one. They both said this was rare. They shrugged it off. The teacher said she was sure Rachel is the kind of girl who will make a thoughtful decision about when to have her own child.</p><p begin="00:46:47.49">Overall, the girls had a way more authentic mothering experience with the robot babies than I'd expected. But the moments when Rachel and Paige couldn't be available to the babies-- when Rachel gave blood, when Paige fell-- the girls lost points in those moments. When you're a real parent, those things happen all the time.</p><p begin="00:47:06.61">Diagnosing whether your kid needs to be fed or diapered or rocked, that's not what makes you a pro at parenting. It's coping with the stress of getting it wrong, of feeling like an amateur, which is going to happen-- no matter how much practice you've had.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:47:30.34">Hillary Frank, she's the host of WNYC's parenting podcast, <i>The</i> <i>Longest</i> <i>Shortest</i> <i>Time,</i> which I have to say, is great because unlike most parenting stuff, it is not actually designed specifically for the parents. As a non-parent, I could say, I found especially enlightening the recent series on sex and parenting.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Three. Commander In Brief.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:12.22">If somebody needs to sub for the President, the chain is clear. If the Vice President can't do it, it goes to the Speaker of the House, then the President pro tempore of the Senate, then the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, all the way down the Cabinet to Energy, Education, Veteran Affairs. It's been this way since the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. But what happens if all of those people are in one room?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barack Obama</h4><p begin="00:48:39.80">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:48:47.47">The State of the Union address, what if someone blows up the building and kills everyone on that list all at once? Well, then the presidency goes to the designated survivor. That is a person chosen every year before the State of Union speech to survive.</p><p begin="00:49:04.32">That's their whole job, to survive, run the United States government as an amateur president, total beginner, whose first day on the job may include wreaking vengeance upon slash surrendering to whoever killed all our top leaders. Each year, the designated survivor is assigned a security detail and moved to a safe, secret location away from the Capitol.</p><p begin="00:49:26.91">This all began, no surprise, during the Cold War. Thomas Reed was an assistant to President Reagan for national security policy. And it was his job to figure out what to do if a nuclear weapon hit DC. He's the one who came up with the idea of the designated survivor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:49:42.28">Washington was targeted with over 300 Soviet nuclear weapons. They had hundreds that were going to lay down on every possible escape route. And to think you could escape that barrage was nonsense.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Richardson</h4><p begin="00:49:55.03">Well, I was nervous in that I remember saying, jeez, I know this is not going to happen. What if something does happen?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:04.30">That's Bill Richardson, former Secretary of Energy, designated survivor for the 2000 State of the Union. Richardson wasn't sent into a bunker somewhere. He was in a small town in Maryland, having dinner at his friend's house, which was surrounded by a security detail and emergency vehicles. Inside, they had steak.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bill Richardson</h4><p begin="00:50:23.64">We had a nice meal. But then we sat in front of the television, and I was smoking a cigar. I had a glass of wine after it was all over.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:33.88">I talked to a couple of designated survivors from the Cold War era, who said they were put on planes and flown to undisclosed locations. One of them got training, where he got to play war games in this secret Doctor Strangelove-esque setting. And they asked him questions like, OK, do you swear in immediately after the President's death? Do you launch missiles at the Soviets? Do you hold your fire? He said the training was so helpful, so enlightening, that he thought nobody should become a designated survivor without undergoing it first.</p><p begin="00:51:05.82">But by the end of the Cold War, post-Gorbachev, pre-911, things got a little more lax.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:51:12.64">Can you say that I went through any kind of training course about what to do? The answer is no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:17.51">That's Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, designated survivor during the 1997 State of the Union.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:51:23.99">I think I did discuss with my wife that I could handle it if something terrible happened. And she says, well, good luck.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:31.26">Donna Shalala, who was Secretary of Health and Human Services, designated survivor in 1996, didn't get any special training either. And she didn't even leave the neighborhood. She was just two and a half miles away from the Capitol, at the White House.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna Shalala</h4><p begin="00:51:44.95">So I took my senior staff to the Roosevelt Room at the White House, and we had pizza and watched the State of the Union. And I wandered into the Oval Office and tried out the chair.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:55.32">What did it feel like?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Donna Shalala</h4><p begin="00:51:56.88">Big, too big for me. President Clinton's a very large man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:52:05.59">One designated survivor told me that actually attending the State of the Union is a pain. You have to look attentive and interested and approving for a really long time, in case the cameras pan to you. Being designated survivor, much easier.</p><p begin="00:52:20.49">One guy who asked I not use his name went on a vacation to the Caribbean when he got the gig. Not a government expense, he was quick to tell me. He happened to have plans to go anyway.</p><p begin="00:52:30.88">Another designated survivor took the opportunity to move to a new house. A caravan of Secret Service guarded him as he loaded up his moving van.</p><p begin="00:52:40.78">One thing you might have noticed from the designated survivors I spoke to, none of them had day jobs that had anything to do with national security. Usually it's the non-marquee Cabinet members, Secretary of the Interior, Energy, Commerce, Agriculture, people whose names you probably don't know.</p><p begin="00:52:58.05">Ever heard of Anthony Foxx? He's our Secretary of Transportation and this year's designated survivor. And when I heard about that, I kind of thought, well, seriously? The decision to launch nuclear retaliation, kill millions of people could possibly rest in the hands of the Secretary of Transportation?</p><p begin="00:53:17.16">Thomas Reed, the guy who designed this program says, why not? The Secretary of Transportation is as good a person as any.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:23.96">The question in politics and a lot of other things in life is, compared to who? The question is not is so and so authorized or qualified to be president or governor or a successor. The question is, compared to who? Compared to Joseph Stalin? Of course. Compared to Dwight Eisenhower? Probably not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:43.30">And the Cabinet, they're all brilliant people and certainly have the wherewithal to at least make the initial decisions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:53:52.12">[CHUCKLES]</p><p begin="00:53:54.07">Stephanie, they're not all brilliant people any more than you or I are. And they all have problems. And some smoke too much, and some are overweight, and so forth and so on. They're all human beings.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:54:07.74">And Reed said, the President's been chosen by the American people. And the President chooses the designated survivor. So therefore, by proxy, that person is chosen by the American people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:18.07">Sometimes they choose well, sometimes they don't. That's what politics is all about.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:54:22.43">That's a very ominous statement.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Thomas Reed</h4><p begin="00:54:24.18">[LAUGHS] Yes, yes, it is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:54:28.45">Here's Dan Glickman again, designated survivor, 1997, Secretary of Agriculture.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:54:33.24">I mean, I was not really briefed on what to do if something were to happen to the President. But I have enough confidence in myself that if something were to happen, I would have followed certain basic rules and would have been a good soldier in that case.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:54:48.51">When Glickman was a designated survivor, they flew him to La Guardia Airport in a G3 plane, along with some stern-looking guys in suits, one of whom may or may not have been carrying the nuclear football in a fancy briefcase.</p><p begin="00:55:00.97">Then they got Glickman in a three-car caravan, drove him to his daughter's modest apartment in Manhattan's West Village, and stood guard outside while he watched the speech on TV. Glickman admitted, he did imagine what it would be like.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:55:13.45">I did think about it. It was a very interesting thing that here the Secretary of Agriculture could be President of the United States. And I'd been telling the world all these years that agriculture was the most important part of our government, so, I could reinforce that message, certainly.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:28.30">[LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:55:29.95">All of a sudden, that would be our number one national agenda. It's just agriculture.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:55:33.98">Agriculture, food and agriculture.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:55:36.57">Glickman even said that in his regular job, he was so unimportant that immediately after the speech was over, he lost the security detail. They bailed on him and went back to Washington.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Dan Glickman</h4><p begin="00:55:45.99">In fact, their exact words were "Mr. Glickman, the mission is terminated." And I decided to stay in New York and have dinner with my daughter.</p><p begin="00:55:55.15">And it was cold and raining and sleeting. And once the dinner was over, we went outside of the restaurant. And we couldn't find a cab, so we walked back about 12 blocks, back to my daughter's apartment in a sleet storm. And it struck me that just three or four hours before, I was the most powerful man on the face of the earth for about an hour. And now, I couldn't even get a cab.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:56:21.85">The fact of the matter is, no first term president goes into office knowing how to be president. He learns on the job. Everything's new. And opening that briefcase and deciding whether to launch a nuclear strike, nobody could be ready for that. The President might be as likely to make the wrong choice as the Secretary of Agriculture, or the Secretary of Transportation or the White House intern, or you, or I.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:53.28">Stephanie Foo is one of the producers of our program.</p></div><div class="subjects"><h4>  Chorus 2</h4><p begin="00:56:56.62">(SINGING) I don't know what I'm doing more than half of the time.</p></div>  </div>
