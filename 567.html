  <h3>Prologue.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:00.85">Back in January, a tunnel was discovered in Toronto, a secret tunnel. Basically, a conservation official was walking through wooded ravine in the city and stumbled upon this thing. It was described as sophisticated by police, tall enough to stand in, 33-feet long with support beams, a pine wood ceiling and walls, water resistant lighting, a generator and sump pump to pump out groundwater. And the end of the tunnel, two little rooms were still under construction.</p><p begin="00:00:27.03">Intriguingly, nailed to a wall was a rosary and a plastic red poppy. Canadians use the poppy to commemorate fallen soldiers on Remembrance Day up there. Here in the States, this got a little bit of coverage. But in Canada, it was big news.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 1</h4><p begin="00:00:39.92">No one knows who dug the 30-foot long tunnel near the site of this year's Pan American games in Toronto.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 2</h4><p begin="00:00:46.43">A bizarre tunnel found near one of the venues for the upcoming Pan Am Games has sparked fears of an imminent terror attack.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 3</h4><p begin="00:00:51.85">Rarely has a dirt tunnel received so much attention.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 4</h4><p begin="00:00:54.64">No one knows why it was created. Do you think someone told their kid to dig to China, and the kid actually tried?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 5</h4><p begin="00:01:00.47">It's not just the sophistication the police say is troubling, but  the lack of suspects or a motive.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:06.61">When something unexplained like this happens, of course, people go nuts speculating about what it could be. That's actually what our program is about today. In this case, the media pondered whether the tunnel would be used to plant a bomb at the upcoming Pan Am Games nearby.</p><p begin="00:01:20.71">The Pan Am Games are like an Olympics for North and South and Central America. Or maybe somebody was going to build a meth lab in the tunnel or an operation to grow marijuana. Or they would use the tunnel to hide foreign athletes from the Pan Am Games who might want to stay in Canada illegally. On Twitter, it was #terrortunnel.</p><p begin="00:01:39.70">But the truth of what was going on in that tunnel, and what its purpose was was nothing like any of that. And the way Canadian police figured it out. First of all, can I say, sometimes one is reminded of what a very different country Canada is from the United States.</p><p begin="00:01:54.23">As part of the manhunt for whoever built the tunnel, a policeman tweeted, "If you built a tunnel near the Rexall Centre in Toronto, give us a call, OK?" The Toronto Police pointed out that it is not illegal to dig a hole. Apparently no law was broken. From the start, they said they saw no evidence of terrorism, and they did not want to jump to conclusions. For instance, here's an exchange between then Toronto Deputy Chief Mark Saunders and reporters after he showed them a photo of that rosary and plastic poppy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Saunders</h4><p begin="00:02:21.44">This was found inside the actual tunnel itself. And it was nailed on the wall.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Reporter 6</h4><p begin="00:02:27.36">What does that tell you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mark Saunders</h4><p begin="00:02:28.54">That tells me that this was nailed inside the tunnel on a wall.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:33.58">The police basically went on TV and shared pictures of the stuff that  they found in the tunnel-- a ladder, and the generator, and the sump pump. And they asked the public, does this jog anybody's memory? Anybody know anything about this stuff? And that turned out to be exactly the right move, because watching that coverage was a guy named Boko Marich. He sees that ladder--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boko Marich</h4><p begin="00:02:53.30">And I said to myself, they look exactly like my step ladder, and I bet you any  money this is mine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:59.68">I bet you any money this is mine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boko Marich</h4><p begin="00:03:01.29">And then when I saw sump pump, I said, oh ho, my step ladder and sump pump, but I couldn't believe. I couldn't believe. Like, I couldn't believe myself. I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:14.90">He couldn't sleep because he knew who he'd given the stuff to. Bob  is a contractor, and he lent that stuff to one of his favorite employees, this young guy, just 22, Elton. What was Elton doing? And come to think of it, Elton had been asking to borrow a lot of tools lately.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boko Marich</h4><p begin="00:03:30.66">He was asking me for a shovel, for a pick, for another shovel, and other tools, so many tools. I just would say, OK, if you need it, take it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:45.72">Boko loves Elton. He loves that Elton's a great worker. He loves that, unlike other young people Bob's worked with in the past, apparently, Elton always wants to learn, asks lots of questions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boko Marich</h4><p begin="00:03:55.66">What do you do when you do  the roof? How you connect this? How you joist hangers? What is the distance between and that? Can I do this instead of that? Is this going to carry these supports? Unbelievable, you know?</p><p begin="00:04:07.27">And I joked with everybody. Everybody asked me, who is that guy? This is my adopted son, Elton. Always, I used to tell, this is my adopted son. OK? So I would lend him  any tools he wanted.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:21.48">So the morning after he sees the police pointing to a photo of his ladder and sump pump on television, he goes to pick up Elton to bring him to work, like always. Elton gets in the truck.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Boko Marich</h4><p begin="00:04:31.50">He brought two coffees for me and him. And I said, Elton, tell me one thing, that sump pump. I didn't even ask a full question. He said, Boko, yes, I did. Oh, my god.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:46.60">Boko went to the authorities and made sure that Elton would not get arrested or go to prison for this, and then he turned  him in. The police talked to Elton, satisfied themselves that Elton was not a terrorist or an evil criminal mastermind, but just some guy, and they let him go. They didn't even give him a fine. Though they did suggest that he not dig more tunnels. Canada.</p><p begin="00:05:10.04">So who is Elton? Why did he do it? Why go to the trouble? Well, Elton has not given many interviews, though he did allow one reporter named Nick Kohler to spend a couple days with him and his family to write this long story about them in <i>Maclean's</i> <i>Magazine,</i> and Nick was able to tell us a lot about Elton. Elton turned down our request for an interview.</p><p begin="00:05:30.57">Elton was maybe two minutes from the ravine and woods where the tunnel was found in a kind of a rough neighborhood in public housing. Nick says both of his parents are from Jamaica.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick Kohler</h4><p begin="00:05:39.31">He lives with two sisters, an older sister and a younger sister, and they all live their mother.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:44.69">Elton is  the quiet kid in  the family. Nick says everybody else is a big talker.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick Kohler</h4><p begin="00:05:48.37">And I think in particular, his older sister, Anora, she has a lot of ideas about how Elton should be living his life. And she's not shy about kind of sharing that with him. She's a big fan of self-help books. And so I think Elton is often in  the position of listening to life talks, as they put it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:16.54">Advice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick Kohler</h4><p begin="00:06:17.74">Advice. And Elton found refuge ever since he was a kid in the ravine.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:27.24">In the ravine, there were no life talks. And from time he was little, Elton was  this introspective kid who loved to build, to take machines apart, and put them back together. He fixed up old lawnmowers. He built clubhouses. And like he said in a short interview that Nick recorded for a video that <i>Maclean's</i> <i>Magazine</i> made, he'd go to the ravine.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elton Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:06:46.38">OK, what I used to do in the ravine when I was a kid is run around, play hide and go seek. We'd play like apple wars. We'd go fishing. But I started my first tunnel probably when I was in elementary school. I would just go in the creek, walk around, and this is something on my mind. I wanted to go to a clubhouse. I had five or six attempts, and I think the sixth one was the huge one that you guys found.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick Kohler</h4><p begin="00:07:14.99">I've heard him call it the sort of the future of clubhouses.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:19.25">Again, here's Nick.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nick Kohler</h4><p begin="00:07:20.09">The treehouse of the future, that it's underground because one of the fundamental things he wanted from this was that it be secret. It was his secret place that he could go and just relax and be alone.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:38.29">And not always alone. A friend helped Elton dig the tunnel and build it, excavating, he thinks, two dump trunks of dirt by hand, and once it was done, they would go there together, watch movies, listen to music, barbecue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elton Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:07:50.97">OK, I did this because it something I always wanted to be doing, but I know I should have grown out of it, and I knew that, OK, if I build a tunnel, it came from childhood reasons, but at the same time, if I build it, who knows? I could probably hang out there and turn that childhood dream into like, a man cave, a bunker, whatever you call it.</p><p begin="00:08:10.66">Just a place to go hang out, and if there is something that happened like a natural disaster or something would happen, I could go there if there's a blackout, turn on a generator and charge my phone, even make a small meal down there just to bring back up to my house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:29.95">Back when Elton would go to the tunnel, his sisters did not know exactly what he was doing. But they knew something was up. For months, while he was digging the thing, he would come home just covered in dirt, tracking dirt everywhere. Anora thought he was building some kind of underground house and grilled him about it, but he wouldn't say. His other sister, Tracy Ann, found the rosary actually sitting at a bus stop and gave it to Elton to protect him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elton Mcdonald</h4><p begin="00:08:52.45">As soon as she gave it to me, an hour later, I was already down there. I nailed it up. After that, every day I would go there, I would sometimes make a prayer. Not every day, some days I would forget. But sometimes I'd remember to have a little prayer just that I'm safe and some peace of mind.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:13.48">The reality of Elton's tunnel, it was so different from what people thought it was when it was first discovered by police. And I think what that's about is I think when we encounter something inexplicable or mysterious, our imaginations, we are such hacks. You know? We go to the most standard, stock, seen in 100 TV shows version of what something probably is.</p><p begin="00:09:33.54">Like, oh, it's a terrorist attack. Oh, it's dealers, you know? When the reality of what this tunnel really was, it was this dreamy guy who just wanted a place to get away from his sisters and be alone for a little while. It's so much smaller, but so much less predictable and way more interesting.</p><p begin="00:09:51.99">Well, today on our program, what's going on in there? We have stories where people think that they know exactly what is going on in situations of various kinds, and we get inside and find out just how much more interesting the reality of all of it is. From WBEZ Chicago, it's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act One. I Can Explain.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:16.12">Act 1, I Can Explain. This story is about a teenager in a situation where everybody in her life thought they knew exactly what was going on with her and what she should do. It seemed so clear to everybody else, and she would not do it.</p><p begin="00:10:29.75">This teenager met a producer from Public Radio station WNYC, a producer named Courtney Stein, two years ago. And Courtney works on this project called Radio Rookies. And the teenager, her name is Rainey, she was 17 years old at the time, she applied to be in the Radio Rookies program. She wanted to make a radio story, and she wanted to talk about how she had been in an abusive relationship for a long time and was trying to figure out why she stayed in it for so long.</p><p begin="00:10:54.64">And Courtney, the radio producer, was not sure that Rainey was ready to tell that story. It just seemed so soon, but Rainey wanted to, and the school principal thought it would be a good idea because it would give Rainey a reason to come to school, which at the time, she needed. So Courtney said, OK. Here's Rainey back then.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:11:12.50">Are you recording?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:11:13.70">Yeah, she's recording.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:11:15.06">I'm recording. This is live recording coming from West Brooklyn's Community AC Office.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:11:21.92">I started reporting the story in the Fall of 2013.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:11:26.46">This is Radio Rookie Lorraine reporting live.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:11:30.68">I hadn't really been going to school for over two and a half years. So I transferred to an alternative high school for kids who dropped out but are trying to come back and graduate. We all have assigned counselors. We call them ACs.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:11:43.69">OK, so I'm here with my own AC, Elizabeth.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:11:46.38">They check in with us every day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:11:49.02">So how have I been as a student?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elizabeth</h4><p begin="00:11:52.61">Lorraine, when I first started, Lorraine was only a name on my roster because she would never come to school, and now she's here every day. She's doing what she needs to do, and she's a potential June graduate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:12:06.91">Definite June graduate. Clear that up. I got to clear that one up.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:12:12.81">Since I never came to school when I first transferred here, Elizabeth only knew me by my school ID picture.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elizabeth</h4><p begin="00:12:18.32">So my first impression of you-- I saw your picture. I saw a little girl in size with a black eye. So I thought to myself, what's going on? I said, did you get into a fight? And you said, no. But you were like, ah, it's a long story. You'll get to know me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:12:41.22">I had a black eye for the whole first week. I thought people were thinking that I got beat up by a girl or something, that I'm soft.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:12:49.87">Do the dance.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:12:53.34">Nicole is my best friend. But I call her my step  sister because my mom and her dad used to date. And we all live together, kind of like a family. I'm the only one who calls her Nicole. Everyone else calls or by her nickname.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:13:06.10">My name is Nicky Boombox, but no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:13:08.58">She was with me when I first met-- I don't want to use his actual name. What should his name be in my story?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:13:15.93">Doo doo face.</p><p begin="00:13:16.74">[LAUGHING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:13:17.72">I'm going to call him Tony, the guy who became my first serious boyfriend. I met him the summer after eighth grade. By the time we started dating, I was 14 and he was 21, six years, six months, and six days older than me, 666. It's creepy, right? Nicole remembers when we met him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:13:39.25">In the beginning, don't get me wrong. He fooled me too. He fooled all of us. I really thought he was actually really good. I was like, oh, my god, he's really nice. I would never expect him to actually ever lay a hand on you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:13:51.25">So what do you think drew me to him in the first place? What made me start liking him?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:13:56.17">His looks. You can't deny the fact that he's older.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:13:59.82">He's short with tan skin, big pretty eyes, and an Italian schnoz. He has tattoos and a clean-cut beard. When you think of that arrogant guy that all the girls want, that's Tony. He walks with confidence, dresses flashy, and wears big jeans.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:14:17.57">But he also made you feel like you were special, like you were wanted. He was actually putting some effort into it. He would text you back. He would pick you up from the school. He didn't even try to kiss you the first time you hung out. The poems, the song, the rap he made on Facebook.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:14:37.95">He made a video of it. The lyrics went something like, "don't worry baby, it doesn't matter about the age." Back then Nicole took  a video of me watching it. I really couldn't stop smiling. Whereas as Nicole would say-- cheesing OD.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:14:54.13">Wow, Nick!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:14:54.98">Yeah, you're cheesing OD. I never seen you cheese like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:14:59.85">When we first got together, he liked that I was smart and young and pretty. He wanted to shape me into his perfect wifey before I got to the age where he says girls become whores. I was getting 90s when I started the ninth grade. I would show him my report card, but he didn't pay it any mind. He just saw high school as  a place where guys could bag girls.</p><p begin="00:15:23.34">He didn't tell me to skip school. He just punished me when I went. He'd ignore me after I came back or show up at school and flirt with girls in front of me. So I just hung out with him in his room all day instead of going to class. I didn't want him to think I was cheating. I wasn't even talking to Nicole.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:15:45.18">Everything you thought was just about him, like, you just completely stopped caring about everything, and he really had that control over you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:15:53.37">How did I look back then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:15:56.36">You looked like a ghost, completely dead, skinny as hell. Like, you still looked good, don't get me wrong, but you still had that dead look in your face like you weren't happy at all.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:16:07.19">He was verbally abusive way before he became physically abusive. He talked to me so nasty that I could feel it. The bruises clear up, but the words stick with you, and they change how you act. He would tell me, you're boring, you're awkward, you're the weirdest of the weird. You'll never fit in anywhere.</p><p begin="00:16:28.45">And I believed him. I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere. I didn't talk to anyone anymore, including my mom. I lied to her about how old he was, and started coming home late or not at all.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:16:42.59">I was livid, and I wanted you home.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:16:45.19">This is my mom. She used to be a drug addict, but she's been clean for 10 years now. She is pretty ditzy and forgetful, but she's definitely there for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:16:54.83">What were you doing then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:16:56.70">Worrying, cursing, yelling.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Rainey</h4><p begin="00:17:00.73">At me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:17:01.95">At you, at him.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Rainey</h4><p begin="00:17:03.67">You tried punishing me, tried taking my things away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:17:06.13">Punishment, taking your things away, it didn't matter.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:17:09.88">Nothing she did worked because I wouldn't let it. She knew I was the one that could stop myself from seeing him. The first time he hit me was because I was looking through his Facebook. I caught him messaging his ex, so he slapped me across the face. He was yelling at me, telling me to get out. It escalated from there.</p><p begin="00:17:33.66">Then one night two years into our relationship, we went to his friend's birthday, and he got really drunk. I went to sleep at his place, and I woke to him pouring water on my face and dragged me out of bed by my hair. He was yelling and calling me names like a dirty whore and a slut and a piece of trash. He slapped me and grabbed things from around the room like lighters, and medicine bottles, and threw them at me.</p><p begin="00:18:03.99">He was screaming that he hopes my mom dies. I had choke marks on my neck, but he wasn't really choking me to cut off oxygen. It was more like choking me to grab me and throw me around. After he did that, I went over to Nicole's. My mom showed up there and started freaking out and crying when she saw me. So I walked down the block to my friend Steven's house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Steven</h4><p begin="00:18:26.51">You came, and then I seen you and once I seen you, I just felt bad. And then you started crying, and you told me you didn't see it yet. So I brought you into my bathroom, and I made you look, and you didn't want  to look at it. So I told you we weren't leaving until you looked at it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:18:45.23">When I looked in the mirror, I saw a face covered in tears, red and swollen with blue marks on my cheeks, under my eyes, on my neck, and on my arms. I just couldn't believe I was looking at my own reflection.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:18:58.82">And when he hit you, I wanted to have him arrested, but you wouldn't let me.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:19:02.72">My mom promised me she wouldn't call the police, but it was a trick because she knew my brother would.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:19:09.09">They came. They tried to talk to you, but you wouldn't give him up.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:19:13.27">I saw the cop car outside. So I hid in the bathroom. The cops stood outside the door and kept asking me if I got hit. He was like just say, yeah. That's all you have to say. I said, no. So I didn't press charges.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:19:26.49">What did you guys-- you guys filed a report or something, what did you guys do?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:19:29.70">No, they wouldn't let us file a report. We tried to any which way get him for something, and we couldn't because you were over 16. There is no proof that he was having sex with you before that age. So I couldn't have him arrested.</p><p begin="00:19:45.91">They told me I needed to go to the DA. So I called the DA, and they didn't want to be bothered with it because it was consensual, which isn't the law. The law is that he's an adult, and he shouldn't have been having sex with you. That's the law, and he should have went to jail.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:20:02.44">After that happened, he and   I didn't talk for a week. Then he showed up in my school. He had this really sad face on. He brought me a burger. He doesn't know how to say sorry. So I guess the whole act was kind of like an apology. We walked around the neighborhood for a couple of hours.</p><p begin="00:20:20.46">He played one of those toy vending machine games with the arm and he got me a baby blanket with a dog head and tail. It wasn't much, but the look on his face was just so sad that, I don't know. It convinced me to go back.</p><p begin="00:20:40.79">He was overly nice at first-- extra big smiles, longer kisses. But then he started talking about how you got to put your girl in her place. He kept accusing me of cheating on him, and I just had enough. So after two months, we finally broke up, and I moved back in with my mom.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Rainey</h4><p begin="00:21:00.31">How do you feel since I came back?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:21:04.33">Oh, so relieved that I have my baby back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:21:07.75">I'm so done with it, I'm just like, [SINGING] Free like birds, and wings, and a cage. I feel I like I feel great. [LAUGHING] It feels good not to feel bad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:21:19.18">Thank god. Thank god.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:21:22.07">This is Nicole again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:21:23.26">I still hate him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:21:24.64">I'll always hate him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:21:25.74">Like he'd be the one that I would kill. I would keep his boxers on, but cut him up into little pieces, put cement in a body bag, dump him down in the ocean, and just smile smile with happiness.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:21:37.97">And just smile, ladies and gentlemen.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:21:39.90">The monster is gone. We got to get rid of these monsters. I'm just telling you. I'm going to be the one. I'm going to be Dexter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:21:45.95">She's confessing murder.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:21:47.94">Actually, just because this is recorded, I'm kidding.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:21:53.08">Anyway.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:22:07.73">So I'm looking through my old diary. I mean, I have like diary entries from the very, very beginning. A star means we got into an argument. A heart means it was a good day. The circle means he ignored me the whole day.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:22:30.08">Good things about breaking up with Tony-- I get to hang out with Nicole and get to go back to school. Bad things about breaking up with Tony-- I'm alone. I feel like I just need someone to shock me, to take my mind off things. And I don't have anyone now, even on Christmas. My mom was at her boyfriend's house, so I was on my own.</p><p begin="00:22:56.84">I was just in my bed looking at Facebook, and Tony posted his status saying how Christmas will never be the same. He obviously meant that for me since it was our anniversary. My heart stopped for a second. When he's in my life, I don't know, it's the one thing that just gets me going, really gets me going. I just want him to understand that he was wrong about everything he accused me of. So I decided to try write it all in a letter.</p><p begin="00:23:28.61">I included a playlist with an even number of FU songs and I miss you songs and a weird little purple rock I got from the Museum of Natural History. We started talking, but only over Facebook. I wanted to keep my distance. For a couple of weeks, we went back and forth. He wasn't being pushy. He was actually being really sweet. So I agreed to see him, and I ended up staying the night.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Courtney Stein</h4><p begin="00:23:56.46">This is Courtney, Rainey's Radio Rookies producer. Rainy was working on her story with me for about a month before she disappeared. She stopped returning my texts at Christmastime. When school started again in January, Rainey wasn't there. Then a few weeks into the semester, her English teacher, Aaron, emailed me. Rainey was back. I met her after school, and set her up to record a diary.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Courtney Stein</h4><p begin="00:24:22.40">I'm just going to put it on hold. You don't have to do anything. You can even just put it in your pocket.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:24:27.76">OK, just press Play when I want to record? Or is recording already?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Courtney Stein</h4><p begin="00:24:30.33">No, it's recording.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:24:30.62">OK. I will be back. All the classrooms have teachers. Leave, leave, leave, leave. You know, I don't think I'm supposed to be in this room. Oh, but I'm going to be in here anyway. So I have obviously got back with my ex.</p><p begin="00:24:53.84">I've been on the lookout for abusive behavior to see if he's going to revert back to his old ways. I mean, at first, he was, you know, how you'd expect-- sweet, gentle, nice, caring, all those things. But I've noticed some behavior that I don't like.</p><p begin="00:25:17.99">About two or three weeks ago, he told me to shut up in a nasty way. It's not that big of a deal. But I felt like it was a sign that the pattern might reemerge.</p><p begin="00:25:42.48">He's rough, just by nature. Uhm, I don't think that's abusive, though. I think that's just how he is. But at times, I don't really like it.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:25:58.15">I know that in a lot of ways, he's a really bad person. But I know that he could be a good person. No one's all bad.</p><p begin="00:26:07.27">We slipped back into our old routine of me never going home or going to school almost immediately. He became slowly more disrespectful and then violent, again. I was surprised because I really hoped it was going to be different this time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:26:25.56">I remember being 13 and just  being like, I just want to be 17. When I'm 17, that's going to be  the perfect age to just-- and then I get to 17, and it's like, wow, this is what 17 looks like? This is what my 17 looks like.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Courtney Stein</h4><p begin="00:26:45.49">Rainey barely showed up to school for the rest of the year. She was supposed to graduate, but didn't. From the beginning, Rainey told me she wanted to tell this story so she could try to understand herself and figure out why she was ever with him. She said that if she understood, that might help her leave. So over the course of the next year, Rainey would reemerge for a day or two, go to school, record a bit, and then be gone again.</p><p begin="00:27:12.98">I insisted that if we were going to keep producing this story together that she meet with someone from an organization called Day One. They work with young survivors of intimate partner violence.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:27:22.32">I messed up already. I'm too nervous for this.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Courtney Stein</h4><p begin="00:27:24.24">I brought her to meet with her community educator, Sarah Gonzalez.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Rainey</h4><p begin="00:27:28.14">OK, so my first question is, what are the signs of teen dating abuse?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:27:33.43">So what's extremely common in teen relationships is the forced absence from school. Right? So if I'm forcing you to be absent from school, I'm affecting your grades, which will then affect how you graduate, if you graduate, when you graduate.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:27:47.54">That's actually exactly what happened to me. It's funny you brought that up. I should be a senior now, and I'm still not graduating. So I am usually looked at as someone who could be considered a strong female. I don't let guys mess with me. I don't put up with stuff like that, but then somehow I'm in this relationship that I allow myself to get stepped over.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:28:13.41">The only thing that would change in that is the allow part. Right? People even with good intentions unintentionally blame victims or survivors, right? So we say things like, if that person just had self-esteem, it would be OK.</p><p begin="00:28:28.34">What that tells someone is that its your fault because you don't have the esteem to leave when that's not really the case. On average, it takes seven to nine times for someone to leave. So just because someone went back doesn't mean that they are never going  to leave.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:28:44.30">Every time we get into a fight and things start getting really bad, I'm just sitting there like, you should be leaving right now. You need to get your stuff. You need to get out the door. You need to go home. And I never do it every single time. And every single time, I blame myself because I have feet. I can walk if I want to, but I don't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:29:02.97">Have you ever asked yourself the other question, what makes me stay? Or what keeps me here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:29:09.03">I mean, I do, and I don't understand the answer because it doesn't make sense why being happy 5% of the time makes you stay. I don't know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:29:18.39">You know, you do love your partner, right? And so a lot of times what you really want is just for the abuse to stop, but you still want to be with your partner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:29:27.50">I mean, we have happy times. We'll cuddle and laugh, sometimes he even cooks or makes us tea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Gonzalez</h4><p begin="00:29:37.65">But you can say, OK, I should be leaving. And if you don't, it's just like today wasn't the day that I was leaving, as opposed to blaming yourself because that might keep you here  a little longer. It's like, OK, it didn't happen today, but it can happen tomorrow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elizabeth </h4><p begin="00:30:00.21">I know what you're doing with your life. I know you're at that boy's house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:30:03.49">My assigned counselor has been leaving me voicemails. I never even listen to them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elizabeth </h4><p begin="00:30:07.84">So don't shut down because you're with this boy. We already spoke about this. The weather was bad. You don't do snow. I know all your excuses in the book. But right now, the weather is better. So you should've been here today. So obviously, if I don't see you later, that means it's not good,  OK? So call me or show up. Bye.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:30:25.60">When the new cycle started, I told him I had to go back to school, and not even five minutes later, he held me down and started sucking on my neck. I was like, get off babe, you're hurting me. He didn't do it for very long, but he did it hard enough to leave a huge, dark, purple mark. I guess he was trying to mark his territory.</p><p begin="00:30:48.48">When you haven't gone to school in a really long time, and you come in with a hickey, that looks bad. I tried to cover it up. I felt like my teacher is going to look at me so disappointed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:30:59.51">Testing, testing, recording, recording, hello. School just ended about 15 minutes ago, and today is the first day I've been in school for at least the past month. It's not something I'm very proud of.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:31:19.75">I'm sure you're thinking, who the hell stays with someone like him for this long? Believe me, I get it. I think I'm an idiot.</p><p begin="00:31:28.39">I don't know what makes me stay. I mean, one time I was trying to leave, and he took my sweater into the bathroom and peed on it. He spit in my face in front of company more than once. There's some things he's done to me that are just so embarrassing I've never told anyone.</p><p begin="00:31:46.88">I don't want people to look at me and say, you allowed him to do that to you, and you're still with him? So I just shut down, and don't talk to anybody, including Nicole. This is what she thinks of the situation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:31:59.79">I feel like basically you don't leave is because that when you come home, there's really no one here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:32:06.12">She means that my mom works a lot and spends the weekends at her boyfriend's. So she's not always home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:32:11.90">Presently, you really have nobody. I feel like that's the real reason, because you're used to that environment, always being with him every day. I know it's hard for you. We say it's hard for you to make new friends. Meanwhile, it's really not that hard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:32:27.35">I didn't have that much of a hard time making friends when I was younger. I wasn't like that. I don't know when it changed or how it changed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:32:34.95">Because he shut down your  whole confidence. It's hard to come back when you don't talk to anyone, and you haven't talked to or interacted with a person in how long? And you expect to interact--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:32:48.97">Yo? Hello? Hi, [BLEEP]. What are you doing? Are you drunk? You promise?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:33:01.95">Nah, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey </h4><p begin="00:33:03.19">Because you're talking like you're twisted. Why are you laughing? Are you laughing at me because I'm an idiot?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:33:10.10">I'll think about all this stuff he's done to me, and just be like, I hate him. I hate him. I hate him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:33:17.35">What are you talking about? You're not putting me on nothing. I'm going to stab you in the face. Not you, oh. All right, bye.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:33:33.04">What happened? He doesn't take your effort. He doesn't take you serious.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:33:37.93">He doesn't.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Nicole</h4><p begin="00:33:39.37">You don't scare him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:33:41.97">I think this wouldn't have happened with someone my own age. I mean, Tony was the first guy I was ever very seriously with. I didn't know anything really about being in a relationship. So I trusted him on how he thought things should be. In the beginning, I was always worried that he would break up with me.</p><p begin="00:33:59.17">I remember the first time he did. I was just shivering, literally shaking. I didn't know how to be without him.</p><p begin="00:34:07.97">I can't believe that I've been with them for five years now. That's over a quarter of my life. The first 50% of my life, I was probably pissing my pants and my mom was on drugs. So I blocked a lot of it out. Then  I was fat for the next five years. Then I have this [BLEEP]. I'm wasting my life.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:34:27.89">Oy, vey. Yep, so another diary. It's just come to a point where I'm pretty much unhappy all the time. I can't do this much longer. I get told all day, every day that I'm an evil monster. And men, mens are the ones that made the Verrazano Bridge. That's his philosophy. That's what he says to me. Women are evil. And if you're born with a vagina, you deserve to suffer.</p><p begin="00:35:14.33">And he yells at me and tells me that I'm not learning because I don't agree. Why would I agree that I need  to be punished just because I  was born?</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:35:29.44">The longer I live with him, the more angry I get. He won't let me express my emotions. He won't let me cry. He won't let me yell. Some girl kept coming around. She would not leave him alone. I wanted to beat her up, but then she started telling me what was actually going on, that she'd  been seeing him on and off for the past two years.</p><p begin="00:35:51.86">This isn't the first time he's cheated on me, but she's the youngest. She just turned 15. And Tony's 25 now. He's doing the same things to her that he did with me.</p><p begin="00:36:05.33">I always felt like I needed this huge epiphany or something crazy big to happen to end the cycle. But something just broke inside me. The switch turned off, and that was it. I'm done with him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:36:30.97">All right, Mom, I want you to be as cheerful as possible, and don't think I'm going to get mad at you for anything you say.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:36:37.47">I haven't really been home since I got together with Tony. I haven't had a chance for  my mom to baby me. I feel like I missed out on that, for a lot of my life actually.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:36:48.75">What did you say when I said me and him were breaking up this time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:36:53.24">I said, thank god.</p><p begin="00:36:54.81">[LAUGHING]</p><p begin="00:36:56.18"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:36:57.56">Did you believe me?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:37:00.31">I prayed, so yeah. I wanted to believe you, yes, absolutely.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:37:05.54">Are you watering your truth down maybe just a little bit because I got mad at you last time you said that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:37:10.87">Yeah, you did get mad at me the last time I said that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:37:14.16">The last time you said-- what the hell did you say? Oh, I said that we were broken up, and you said, for how long this time? In two weeks, you're going to be back together, something like that. Is that how you really felt?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:37:27.57">Well, that's how it's been, basically. The longest you've broken up so far  is six months.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:37:38.07">Do you think my relationship with him is like a drug, or like an addiction?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:37:41.93">Absolutely. Yes, I do. I think it's a drug that you can't seem to stop. You know it's no good for you, and you want it. You want to caress it. You want to hold it. You want it to be in your body, to be next to your body. You want to suck in every minute thinking its life, and then when it's over, you feel that it's not.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:38:11.42">Does my behavior remind you in any way of your own?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:38:15.74">Absolutely, it's just like me. Only mine was with the drugs, and I couldn't stay away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:38:24.54">Do you think I was in any way more susceptible to being in an abusive relationship because of how life was growing up?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:38:32.49">I actually didn't see that coming, but I do see with the caretaker, you want to take care of a man, and I'm kind of the same way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4> Rainey</h4><p begin="00:38:42.43">You also take care of Pop Pop like he's your child more than you take care of me like I'm your child.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:38:46.07">Pop   Pop is my grandpa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:38:47.52">You're not a child anymore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:38:51.20">If this could record my face.</p><p begin="00:38:53.79">[LAUGHING]</p><p begin="00:38:56.26">Yeah, so I don't know if there's anything else I'm supposed to ask you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:39:01.86">I'm glad you're not with him now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:39:04.66">So am I.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:39:05.46">And I love you with all of my heart, all of my heart, all of my being, and all my body, and I don't to see you with him. I really don't. I hope you can find somebody, a better somebody that you deserve, someone that deserves you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:39:20.20">So before I end this recording, do you believe this is the last time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mom</h4><p begin="00:39:26.22">From your lips to God's ears, yes, I'm going to believe you. Definitely the power of prayer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rainey</h4><p begin="00:39:35.61">I guess we'll end on that note.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:39:44.31">Since Rainey completed this story, she's graduated high school. She hopes to attend college. She's moved out of state, and has no plans to reconcile with her ex-boyfriend. We did get a hold of the ex-boyfriend, of Tony, and we asked him for an interview, which he didn't want to do.</p><p begin="00:39:58.64">We told him what was in the story. He sent back a short response saying that many of her claims were inaccurate, but he did not specify which ones. He also said that in a couple of cases, she left things out. Rainey's story was produced in partnership with Radio Rookies at WNYC and their staff-- Courtney Stein, Andrew Mambo, and Kaari Pitkin.

  <h3>Act Two. RSV-Pa.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:38.37"><i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life,</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, what's going on in there, stories where we go into situations where people think they know what's going on, and we find out what's really happening. We've arrived at Act 2 of our program. Act 2, RSV-Pa.</p><p begin="00:40:52.34">So Larry is 20 years old. He's a student. And he's wondered what's going on in there his whole life about his own father. His dad immigrated from Fujian Province to America before Larry was born. He came here with nothing, worked 15 hours a day at a Chinese takeout restaurant that he owned. So Larry never saw him much, let alone talked to him.</p><p begin="00:41:09.99">Larry's parents never tried to teach him Chinese. So Larry only speaks English. His dad only speaks Chinese, which Larry says is something that happens in the Fujianese community. Some of his friends can't talk to their parents either. In Larry's case, he has always wondered what was going on his dad's head. Bianca Giaever has the story.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:41:28.31">Larry's dad spoke two dialects of Chinese, Fujianese and Mandarin. Larry could barely tell the difference between the two. Larry's mom spoke to him in English. She felt that since he lived in America, learning English was his first priority. And she assumed that he'd just pick up Chinese. He didn't. So without anybody meaning for it to happen, Larry wound up completely unable to speak to his dad. They've never had a single conversation.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:41:54.21">I can't even hold eye contact with him. It's just so hard. It's so awkward. It's like when you're on the subway, and you think you saw someone that you know, take a quick glance, you meet eyes, and you look away as quick as-- you look away because it's awkward.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:42:11.45">Larry's dad worked so late sometimes Larry would go days without seeing him. And even when they did have a rare chunk of time together, it wasn't exactly quality father-son time. It was actually the opposite.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:42:23.32">Especially if we were like having dinner together or something and my mom's not home, he'll call me down, and I'll set the table, and we'll just both be picking at the food not saying a word.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:42:34.83">And then it would be complete silence the entire time you guys were eating?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:42:38.62">Yeah, definitely.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:42:39.98">Can you like list off the things that he would say to you that you can understand?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:42:43.47">It really just came down to whether I one, healthy, or two, hungry. And if I was not hungry, and if I was healthy, then I was good. It was definitely upsetting, especially growing up. But I think it got to a point where I just didn't really register that feeling anymore. I just started feeling nothing for him when I would see him. It would just be basically a wall to me. It was like a third wall, and it's like I'd walk right past him.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:43:18.63">When Larry was eight, his little brother was born, and his parents sent his brother to Chinese school. And as he grew up, his brother could talk to his dad. The two of them got along great. Larry would watch the two of them making jokes with each other, laughing, smiling.</p><p begin="00:43:32.41">Before that, he said he didn't even know his dad could laugh. And Larry's feelings shifted. He remembers thinking, oh, I was the testing ground. I was a mistake. He figured that his dad realized his blunder not teaching Larry Chinese and made up for it with his little brother, which was great for them, except he didn't make much of an effort to fix his relationship with Larry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:43:56.57">I just really felt angry towards him. I just felt strong resentment, because in my head, I thought that he definitely does not love me, and so I'm not going to care about who this person is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:44:11.70">When Larry was 14, the construction business that Larry's family owned in China took off. It was making more money than the takeout restaurant, so Larry's dad moved back to China in order to send more money home. He wrote Larry a letter to say goodbye.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:44:25.40">So it's about six pages long. On the left side is the Chinese, and on the right side, it's the English that my aunt translated.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:44:36.98">Larry got the letter after his dad had already gone. Here are some excerpts read by Larry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:44:42.13">"Son, I remember the days after you were born. I was thankful because your arrival brought me a brilliant outlook in life. When I wrote this letter, I struggle tremendously. However, it  is a father's duty to mentor his son. I cannot communicate with you.</p><p begin="00:44:58.08">Time flies. In the blink of an eye, I will turn 40 years old. In another two or three years, you'll leave mom and I to attend college, learn the necessary skills, be independent, sorting and organizing your books to keeping your desk clean will leave a good and lasting impression on others.</p><p begin="00:45:15.55">Before you go to school every morning, remember to eat something. Do not pressure yourself. As long as you are unafraid of working hard, there will be a path for you. I cannot speak English, and I've been able to support my family all these years. So relax and do your best.</p><p begin="00:45:31.52">Thank God for giving me the courage to write this letter to my oldest son. I believe deeply that to gain anything, you must surrender something. Conversely, anything that you surrender, you must gain something back. Pardon for my sharing, Pa."</p><p begin="00:45:48.92">I read it through the first time, and by the end of it, I'm really crying. It just really hit  me hard because that was the first time he ever said I love you. Every line just made me start crying over again.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:46:03.06">This is like one moment where you realize everything you thought was totally wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:46:06.19">Yeah. I felt so guilty because it was basically my fault for not understanding that this is actually how he feels.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:46:18.49">Was some part of you like, why didn't you tell me this earlier?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:46:21.14">No, because my dad's main focus was making sure we have a place to live and we had food. In my head, I envision my dad working 14 hours a day, standing by hot oil, cooking and lugging around boxes and stuff like that. So when I put it into perspective, I realize he bears a lot more burden than I do, than I will ever bear.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:46:45.86">What Larry saw in the letter was his dad had been thinking about him all this time. He had been noticing him and worrying about him. So Larry gets this amazing letter that totally changes how he sees his father, and he never writes him back.</p><p begin="00:47:00.45">Remember, he was 14 in middle school. He wasn't mature enough to know how to respond, but he decided he'd study Chinese some day so he could finally talk to his dad. He started taking classes in college, but he's still not fluent.</p><p begin="00:47:13.88">Six years later, he still never had a real conversation with his dad. If he couldn't do it in Chinese, he figured, it would be the same as it always was. But a few months ago, he started writing a letter to finally respond to the letter his dad sent years ago.</p><p begin="00:47:29.01">We hired a translator to turn the letter into Chinese, and our translator coached Larry on how to read it. We recorded Larry reading the letter and edited the sound so it would all be perfect. The plan was to get Larry's dad on the phone from China, play him the recording of the letter, and then they'd talk with the translator's help. Larry was excited to finally get a sense of who his father was, where he came from, what  he thought about, and that's what we did.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:47:54.42">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:47:55.22">Larry, you want to just [INAUDIBLE].</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:47:57.44">[SPEAKING  CHINESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:47:58.95">We got Larry's dad on the phone and played the recording for him. For the first time, his dad heard his son speak in a language he could understand. Here's what his dad heard.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:48:09.42">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Bianca Giaever</h4><p begin="00:48:14.42">And here's the English translation, read by Larry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:48:18.14">"Dear Pa, when I think about our house when I was a kid, I think about mom cooking greens and soy sauce chicken. I think about the whole family yelling at each other over the dinner table, typical Fujianese. It's so loud. And then I think about you, reading  a book on the couch, totally silent.</p><p begin="00:48:38.94">Sometimes mom would come up to me and say, go spend some time with dad. I remember saying there's no point. We can't even speak to each other. She'd say, just try it. But I just shrugged and went back to my room. Then I got your letter.</p><p begin="00:48:57.40">I've read it countless times since high school, I treasure it and read it sometimes when I feel down about myself. It makes me feel better about myself, about family. But the most important thing about the letter was that for the first time, I felt like you were speaking directly to me, and I was so surprised by how emotional you were.</p><p begin="00:49:18.07">And when I read that letter, I thought here's someone I care about. I appreciate it, and I want to get to know better. I had so many questions for you at first, what your childhood was like, what would you do for fun, who were your friends, did you know you're going to be working in a Chinese takeout restaurant for two decades?</p><p begin="00:49:36.97">Did you enjoy it? Didn't it mean anything to you? But then I realized that everything I thought about you my whole life was completely wrong. And I felt guilty that I never tried to get to know you. I'm so sorry.</p><p begin="00:49:55.05">But it's not too late. Now that I know a little more about who you are, I want you to know who I am, where I live, where I like to go, who my friends are, what I like to do, what instruments I play. I'm learning Chinese now in school. Hopefully, one day we can actually talk about all these things for real, face to face. Until then, I'm happy to simply know how much we care about each other. I love you, Pa."</p><p begin="00:50:20.08">[SPEAKING  CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:50:22.50"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pa</h4><p begin="00:50:26.63">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:50:29.76">Thank you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Larry</h4><p begin="00:50:33.58">So what's your reaction?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:50:36.85">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:50:38.13"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pa</h4><p begin="00:50:41.94">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:50:43.10"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:50:48.49">I'm quite touched.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Pa</h4><p begin="00:50:51.00">[SPEAKING CHINESE]</p><p begin="00:50:52.27"/></div><div class="subject"><h4>Interpreter</h4><p begin="00:50:57.29">I haven't quite caught up to my own emotions at this moment.

Larry and his dad text regularly now. Larry's Chinese is now good enough where he can understand most of what his dad says, and he can put the rest into a translation app.</p><p begin="00:55:10.59">I read their texts, and it's not deep. It's just normal. Before all this, Larry thought he'd feel closer to his dad if they talked about who his dad's friends were when he was young, what his dreams were. But their texts are the dumb, small things you text with anyone you love. Larry's dad reminds him to buy his mom his present for Mother's Day and complains that his little brother is ignoring his texts.</p><p begin="00:55:33.89">He tells Larry to be careful walking home late at night. Larry texts, "School is good. Weather is starting to cool down." His dad asks him how his new job is, and finally, "Make sure to take care of yourself and eat more food." Larry sends him a thumbs up emoji.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:57.04">Bianca Giaever.
