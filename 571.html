So are you freaking out?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:18.77">I'm a little excited.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:20.61">This man is 76 I'm not going to say his name here on the radio because he's hoping that the woman that he wants to marry is not going to get tipped off by some radio or podcast listener that he's about to ask her. And he doesn't know what she's going to say. He doesn't know, which is not usually how that goes down, right? Usually you ask somebody to marry you, you kind of know. He's totally shooting in the dark, anxious about what she's going to say. And this is somebody who he's had feelings about for a long time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:00:50.05">I met this girl at a time when I was 17. She was 16. She was very popular. She was one of what you might say the queens in high school, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:59.15">But nice, he says-- really nice.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:01.10">And I didn't have all the confidence and courage that I needed at that time. And I just felt like I don't measure up. I mean, she can pick any superstar or whatever. I was a fairly good athlete, but I wasn't the superstar and whatever and stuff like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:17.85">I see. You didn't do everything you could.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:01:20.51">No, I didn't try. I just played like, well, hey, we're just friends. And then when it was time to go to the Navy, I just left. Took the coward's way out.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:34.06">But that experience changed him, he says. When he met his wife, he totally went for it. Didn't want to make the same mistake again. He and his wife were together for nearly 47 years, had children, who are now grown. And when his wife died eight years ago, after some time passed, he checked in with this woman from high school.</p><p begin="00:01:51.85">Well, her husband had died. And so this man started flying to the other side of the country to visit her, where she lives now. He stays in the guest room at her house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:02:00.43">So the visits there-- I would visit her for a week or so. And we hung out every day. And we just did natural things. And we just went places and what have you. But there was really no intimacy involved realistically. We were just hanging out. And I believe she was having a good time. I was having a good time, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:24.71">But you guys didn't kiss?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:02:28.09">Well, maybe only once or twice over those years and what have you. And every time we met, it was a friendly kiss on the side of the face or whatever, but it wasn't anything like a passionate, real kiss. And that happened only once along the way-- once or twice along the way.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:44.59">Now you must have been testing the waters and saying things to figure out where she felt and what her feelings were, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:02:53.58">I was trying very hard to find that out along the way, Ira. And I was getting some mixed signals. I didn't-- I had a sense-- on the one hand, when it was all--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:03.67">OK. Those mixed signals. She'd hold his hand all the time. She never hesitated when he would call her and ask to schedule another week-long visit. But at the same time, she seemed very encouraging about him going out with other people-- like, weirdly encouraging. And she did not seem interested in discussing her feelings towards him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:22.04">It seemed like any time a question or anything came up that kind of related towards that and went in that direction, she tended to slide away from it a little bit.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:34.87">That does not sound good to me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:37.51">That didn't sound good to me either. My feeling was that she doesn't want you to ask this question. She doesn't want to have to give you that answer.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:48.42">Did you tell her you love her?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:50.51">Yes, I did.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:51.84">Has she ever said "I love you" back?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:03:54.45">No. No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:56.61">Well, is it possible she just wants to be friends?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:04:00.76">Very good possibility.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:02.84">OK. Ladies and gentlemen, I know what you're thinking. This does not sound promising at all. And, oh, my god, what lovestruck creatures we all are, wandering around this earth, right? Here is a 76-year-old man, a father, a grandfather, with the same logic-defying feelings dominating him that a teenager has.</p><p begin="00:04:21.94">He told me that back in July, after years of wondering what this woman-- OK, are we always just going to be friends. Is this ever going to be more than that, he finally told her, OK, look, we're going on a date. We're going on a date. It's going to be a real date. Are you up to have a real date with me? And she said yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:36.70">So how'd that go?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:04:38.00">It went well, but it didn't go any differently than all the other dates we went on, so--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:45.63">So nothing really changed?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:04:47.88">No. So realistically, if I want to be just honest with you and what have you, I don't know where this can go, what have you. But my feeling is that either she truly wants me to move on or she's waiting for me to ask this question-- will you marry me? That's really where I am. And I don't know which one is true.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:13.13">But people-- if somebody is interested, they let you know. If a lady is interested, she figures out a way to let you know, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:05:23.58">Yeah. Now some people might say, well, hey, she let you stay at her house. I mean, you stayed there all week.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:32.32">Oh, man, you are stuck on this lady. Oh, my god.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:05:39.25">Well, let's put it this way. That may be the case, but it doesn't change anything. That I just want to know that, hey, I did everything I could. And that's what I didn't do the first time. That's what I didn't do the first time.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:02.63">You know what strikes me is that this is just very inconvenient for you that you like her so much.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:06:09.05">That I like her so much? That that's inconvenient?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:11.69">Yeah. Yeah. That you're having these feelings, that you're stuck on this lady. It seems like you're in the grip of this thing. You don't even have a choice. It defies all good sense. You know all the signs pointing against it. And yet you feel like you have no choice. You have to ask this question.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:06:27.03">Oh, I do have to. Oh, in truth, I understand that. I do have to ask the question. My heart says, resolve it. Just resolve it. And if her heart doesn't want it, then I don't want it with her, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:55.14">Honestly, over the course of this conversation, I went from thinking that it was a terrible idea for him to ask this woman to marry him next week to thinking he should totally do it. He totally convinced me that he needed to hear yes or no once and for all. And maybe he was going to get what he wanted, or maybe he was going to be set free, but either one of those was going to be better than just floating around her like he's been, wanting this thing to happen.</p><p begin="00:07:17.55">And then-- OK, we talked the next day on the phone. And I learned some weird thing happened in that conversation that he and I had had the day before, which is we switched positions. He had completely convinced me that he should ask her, but I had completely convinced him that he should not because she wasn't showing enough signs that she loves him, because it seemed doomed on its face.</p><p begin="00:07:38.65">So the next day-- Tuesday this week-- we got on the phone and he told me his new, very pragmatic, very sober plan. He's not going to ask her to marry him next week. He's just going to tell her his feelings and see if she's open to being in a real, actual committed relationship.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:07:54.29">This opens the door to get started with a relationship. I'm not really saying that she would want to do it-- go there. But if she does, then the question would be, well, where do we go from there?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:07.71">So he flies to his fate this weekend. He's asking her Wednesday, he thinks. The heart wants what it wants. Emily Dickinson wrote that. Though, depending on how old you are, you might associate it with Woody Allen or Selena Gomez.</p><p begin="00:08:21.06">Today on our program, people who get stuck on somebody, whether that's a good idea or not, whether they want to or not, people who get stuck even when the signs are not looking so very good for them at all.

  <h3>Act One. Jesse’s Girl.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:09:24.39">So here's how the con worked. Guys around the country signed up for a pen pal service. It would put them in touch with women they could befriend and correspond with. And then they'd start to receive letters.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:09:35.24">And they come from Hillsdale, Illinois. Some of them are white, pink, green.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:09:43.33">Jesse is a sweet, soft-spoken man with fake plastic aviator glasses. He started receiving the letters in 1985 when he was in his 30s. Back then, he was overweight. He'd never had a serious girlfriend, always lived with his parents. After his mother died, he spent most of his time taking care of his sick dad and working at his family's restaurant. Jesse's favorite letters came from a woman named Pamala.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:10:06.68">Yes, I usually took it at the end of the day when I got them in the mail, went into my room, and laid on my bed and just sat there and read them.</p><p begin="00:10:17.70">"Dear Jesse, Deep down you know as well as I do that you could be a lot better off than you are if you only had someone on your side-- someone who would help you, encourage you, work with you, and stick with you even when things get bad. What I'm talking about, of course, is a true friend. But that kind of person is hard to find today, isn't it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:10:40.95">Jesse had never met or talked to Pamala, but he was curious. He wrote back, telling her a little about himself. And Pamala replied again and again. The letters were typed in a girlish font and signed in a blue pen with big, loopy letters.</p><p begin="00:10:56.27">In another letter, Pamala wrote, "Just before I sat down to write this letter to you, I was thinking how lucky I am that in this great, big, crazy world I found you. I hope I can be part of your life for a long time, darling. And I hope, as time goes by, I'll be able to make you happier and happier."</p><p begin="00:11:14.47">This mystery woman seemed to know him. She made Jesse feel understood. She made him feel loved.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:11:20.47">You can tell when you meet a person that they're not superficial, this is coming from their heart. Everybody's looking for that perfect love and everything. And this pops up. So I thought, well, could this be something different?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:11:38.21">This was Pamala. He was middle-aged, balding, and had a small, gray mustache. His real name was Don Lowry.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:11:46.58">Was any of it difficult to come up with these characters? Did the characters bore you? I mean, tell me about it as a writing project.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:11:53.60">No. No, I'd look at a photograph of the girl, and say, what kind of girl is this? Where is she from? What does she like to do? It was fairly easy after a while. The first 20 were a little bit rough, but the next 80 were not hard at all.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:12:12.90">And you enjoyed making up these characters?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:12:14.71">I loved it. Yeah, I loved it. I meant that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:12:23.83">Don died in 2014, but I met him in 2011 in a rundown house in Butler, Pennsylvania. He was 82. If you have trouble understanding Don's voice, it's because he was a lifelong heavy smoker. The desk in his living room was covered with ash. His sofa smelled of smoke.</p><p begin="00:12:40.98">Don told me he always wanted to be a writer, but his real talent was in being a hustler. He always had a scheme going.</p><p begin="00:12:48.58">In his early 30s, Don visited Mexico and wrote a traveler's guide where he explained how American men could live cheaply there, pick up women, and get by with rudimentary Spanish.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:12:57.31">It was called <i>Mexico,</i> <i>Bachelor's</i> <i>Paradise.</i></p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:13:01.76">It didn't sell. And then he tried something most writers would never consider. He changed the name of the book's author to a woman's name. Sales skyrocketed, he said. Apparently, lonely American men didn't want tips from a guy. They wanted tips from a girl.</p><p begin="00:13:17.91">Don realized there was a market waiting to be exploited. He rented mailing lists from magazines that catered to single men and started writing letters to them, posing as different women. Men like Jesse were invited to join a club where, in exchange for a small fee, they could receive love letters.</p><p begin="00:13:34.16">In a moment of inspiration, Don decided to call the women who wrote the letters angels-- Angel Linda, Angel Kristina, Angel Pamala. He purchased stock photos of models and printed catalogs with photos and bios for each angel.</p><p begin="00:13:48.18">Angels came in different flavors. Some were compliant, helpless, and pure. Others were raunchy and sent nude photos of themselves. Most were young, and all were eager to please. Dream women for a certain kind of man, dreamed up, of course, by another man.</p><p begin="00:14:03.94">In one brochure, Angel Linda Scott is pictured in a one-piece swimsuit on her hands and knees. Angel Kristina looks like an idealistic woman. She's shown hugging a tree and holding a flower. "I prefer a certain type of man," Christina says. "He can pick up a handful of dark, rich soil and feel a kind of reverence and joy, but he's awfully hard to find."</p><p begin="00:14:28.14">Don mailed these brochures to men like Jesse. If a man wrote back, Don began sending letters to him as Angel Kristina or Angel Linda. Don told me he didn't want members who were just looking for sex. He wanted men looking for meaningful relationships who would be in it for the long haul. He thought this would be better for business and better for the marks.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:14:47.71">Guy, his wife died. And he was living alone. He didn't have any friends. That kind of thing. He needed this. He didn't have anything or anybody else to cheer him up. Nobody. We did it. These girls would boost their egos. Things like, oh, your handwriting is so masculine. Things like that-- little things. It gave the guy a boost. And they loved it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:15:24.58">After a few letters to Jesse, Pamala let him know that the only thing she wanted was a little help. "Darling, I want you to know that I really love writing you every day. It has filled a great need in my life, and I know I'd be very sad if I had to stop writing you and being your friend. I hope you feel the same way about me and my letters to you. I think it's fair and reasonable for me to ask you to help with the expenses of paper, envelopes, postage, photos, and the other things I'll be sending you. If you could send me just $10 a week for my letters, I could continue writing every day as I have been."</p><p begin="00:15:57.67">Jesse was fine with that. He figures he sent in $4,000 or $5,000 between 1985 and '88. It wasn't a big deal to him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:16:05.39">My business was prospering pretty well. We ran over $100,000 three years in a row. So it was no problem for me to be sending money and stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:16:17.49">Pamala often sent Jesse stories about the two of them for a little extra money. In one, Pamala and Jesse go on a picnic together. In another, he literally rescues her as a knight in shining armor.</p><p begin="00:16:30.00">There's one story that has them both lying on a bearskin rug in front of a fireplace. And of course, it goes where you think it will go if two people are lying on a bearskin rug in front of a fireplace. But it's romantic, not explicit. The language is tame. The letter concludes, "I lay beside you and whisper, 'Good night, my sweet darling. Let us drift away to paradise in our dreams and wake up together to a new and wonderful day.' I kiss you gently and fall asleep in your arms."</p><p begin="00:17:01.29">OK. Obviously cheesy. Don Lowry was not a gifted writer, but he was a gifted manipulator.</p><p begin="00:17:08.10">When I first heard about the story, I assumed the men who signed up for the letters from the angels must have been such easy marks, so naive. Who else would buy such absurd fantasies? But then, I read the dozens and dozens of letters that Pamala sent Jesse. He saved them in a large binder, each letter in its own plastic sleeve.</p><p begin="00:17:27.37">And as I read the letters, I started to understand the power of the psychological tools Don used to hook men like Jesse. Most of the letters aren't epic fantasies. Most are about the minutiae of Pamala's life. She goes to the bank. She talks to coworkers. She tells Jesse her thoughts on televangelists.</p><p begin="00:17:45.81">Over and over, Pamala tells Jesse how much he means to her. She praises him, encourages him. When you read the letters one after the other, like Jesse did day after day after day, it paints a picture that feels real. I felt the Pamala in the letters was a real person. And I knew Don was writing them.</p><p begin="00:18:04.54">There were other tricks. In one letter, Pamala asked Jesse to keep a picture of hers nearby as he read her letters so he would feel she was in the room with him. Jesse put up two photos of her on the wall. She once sent him a dime. In that letter, she told Jesse she had just had a strange day. Another driver bashed her car, but didn't leave a note.</p><p begin="00:18:25.37">Just when it looked like the day couldn't get any worse, she lost her purse. Depressed, Pamala spotted this very dime on the street. She picked it up, hoping it was a lucky charm. Later, a little boy showed up with her purse, a woman called and took responsibility for the car. Pamala told Jesse she was giving him her lucky dime. Here is Jesse reading from the end of that letter.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:18:47.44">"Keep this dime, darling. Let it always remind you that good people can still come into your life and good things can still happen to you. And also think of this as a small token of my affection for you. If you hold it in your hand and squeeze it hard, you'll feel the warmth of my love coming out of it."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:19:09.59">Did you actually do that, Jesse?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:19:11.48">Yes, I think I did do that and everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:19:15.87">Like I said, Jesse's mother had recently died and his dad had heart trouble. He spent a lot of time looking after him. He wrote letters to Pamala, confiding in her about his depression. She sent him heartfelt letters about bad relationships she'd had. And she told him about visiting her grandfather, who was suffering from dementia.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:19:33.76">That really took its toll on her. So I bonded with that, knowing that she was going through the same thing that I was. Me and her more or less bonded more than any other person I've ever talked to. It was like a beacon from outside. It was like if you were a ship out at sea and you were looking for a lighthouse-- which they used that in the deal, to look for the light and everything and guide yourself towards it, where you know that you'll have safe haven.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:20:11.87">I'm not sure I'm exactly following you. Is this something from one of the letters, where they basically talk about the lighthouse?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:20:18.09">Yes. and, in fact, I got a little wooden figure of a lighthouse that she sent to me at one time and everything. It said, let this beacon know that somebody's out there looking out for you and everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:20:40.33">If Jesse had wanted to see it, there were plenty of signs the letters were mass produced. They look typed, but the paper doesn't have the indentations that come from typewriter keys. The signatures look like they've been stamped or printed. All the specifics in the letters are about Pamala's life.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:20:56.16">In the letters, did Pamala ever ask you how you were handling your mom's death?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:21:02.05">Not that I remember. No, I don't think so.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:21:05.13">Did she ask how your dad's health was?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:21:08.54">Not that I remember at this time, no.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:21:11.62">In fact, when I read Pamala's letters to Jesse, she never mentions any of the things he's told her. When Pamala talks about Jesse's life, she switches into generalities. "I know you're sad. I know you're lonely. I know you're having a hard time." The only way the letters are personalized is that Jesse's name is sprinkled throughout, auto-filled, like a Mad Lib sheet. To Jesse, it didn't matter. He saw what he wanted to see.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:21:36.36">At the time, I wasn't really fully absorbing all of that. I had a lot more on my plate-- in a turmoil with everything that was going on. So I just read them and I took some encouragement out of it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:21:55.95">Did you ever have doubts about what was going on as you were receiving the letters?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:22:01.19">Well, no, not at the time and everything. Like I said, I was glad to be getting letters from somebody. And even though you're paying money for that because you have blinders on and not really paying attention to all of that. And like I said, when you're not the best looking person in the world, that somebody out of the blue that writes to you and tell you things and build up your spirits and everything and stuff because everybody looks at you and stuff, it's like the deal with the hunchback of Notre Dame. You'll never find anybody that will care for you, but there at the end, he wound up making a friend with the people that befriended him and everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:22:45.83">At a certain point, Pamala became the thing that kept Jesse afloat when he had to work long hours, when he had to close his restaurant and rush his father to the hospital.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:22:54.34">Yes, there was one thing that really kindly touched me and everything. I was telling her I'm ready to give up and everything. And she just told me, get back on your feet and everything. So that really was a word of encouragement and everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:23:18.00">As Don went on, he realized his members were hooked and he could take the fantasy further-- much further. He invented an epic world for his angels with a magical backstory and a fantastic future.</p><p begin="00:23:30.12">Here's how it worked. The angels supposedly live together in a retreat hidden away from the world. Most were lost souls, escaping drugs and bad men. These were women who needed a steady hand and a strong shoulder. As he invented more angels, Don came up with interweaving backstories. Some angels were good, some bad. Angels helped one another, backstabbed each other.</p><p begin="00:23:53.90">All the men who signed up to join the Lonely Hearts Club understood they were joining an organization of goodhearted men who were devoted to taking care of the angels. The organization was known as The Call. Don promised members of The Call that they would one day move with the angels to a valley paradise into a giant building shaped like a naked woman lying down on the grass. This lady-shaped building would house meeting rooms and auditoriums. The paradise was to be called Chonda-Za.</p><p begin="00:24:22.68">In exchange for their contributions, the members would have their needs looked after at Chonda-Za, all their needs. At the center of the entire fantasy was a matriarch, a saintly woman named Mother Maria. Maria collected and managed the money from the members, and she organized and disciplined the angels. She was said to have mystical powers and could revirginize fallen women.</p><p begin="00:24:44.67">There were photos of Mother Maria. She was beautiful. Maria's photos were actually of a woman named Esther. She was Don's wife.</p><p begin="00:24:53.73">Not all the members of The Call believed in Chonda-Za. Jesse stuffed the letters describing Chonda-Za in the back pocket of the binder. He figured it was just some wacky idea Pamala had and just ignored it. But there were other fish who found this hook tempting.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Blanchard</h4><p begin="00:25:07.57">In my mind, I always held this area of-- tried not to be convinced 100% about it. Surely, this was too good to be true.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:25:18.35">This is Ken Blanchard. He's a big, gentle man, and was another member of The Call for many years. He was single when he joined. And he was still single when I met him in 2012.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:25:28.63">What was the draw? What did you tell yourself when you said, you know, this is too good to be true?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Blanchard</h4><p begin="00:25:32.64">Well, I think with me it was the prospect of maybe at least having some sort of communication with some women maybe my age, maybe a little bit too young for me-- maybe even then. It sounded like a neat idea to be on the leading edge of something like that. Oh, jeez, I don't know. You know, like I say, I don't know what else here, how else to try to explain my part of it or belief in it or anything. They got me hooked on what they were saying and everything. And I believed them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:26:26.92">Don got hundreds of new sign-ups every year. Millions of dollars flowed back to Don's headquarters in Moline, Illinois. He bought himself expensive cars, a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes. He bought his sons and Esther everything they wanted. He got a big office in downtown Moline and operated a print shop. He hired assistants, salespeople, and ghostwriters to expand his operation. By the mid-1980s, Don was writing love letters to more than 30,000 men.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:26:55.12">We had lawyers, doctors, professors, mechanics, bakers, you name it. All kinds of people were members. We even had a priest join The Call. Really.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:27:11.36">Wait, that's not a Catholic priest?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:27:12.81">Yeah, a Catholic priest.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:27:14.68">What was he hoping to get out of it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:27:16.06">Who the hell knows? He was probably just bored.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:27:19.93">To exploit this growing market, Don constantly experimented with new schemes and products. He started selling cassette tapes, where the angels flirted with the men. He got into merch-- mugs, puzzles, commemorative coins, all with angels' faces printed on them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:27:35.13">And we sent out a pillow case with Angel Terri's face on it. And it said, now you can sleep with Angel Terri every night. We did a lot of things like that.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:27:51.83">The members weren't just sending in cash and checks. They were sending gifts. Ken sent Angel Vanessa a windbreaker. Others sent coats and shoes, even gardening equipment so the angels could grow vegetables at their secret retreat.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:28:04.47">Did you encourage them to send personal items?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:28:06.60">Oh, god. No. No. I hated that. Here's a guy. His wife died. And she left all kinds of jewelry and dresses and so on. He put them in a big cardboard box and mailed it to us. What the hell are we going to do with it? Huh?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:28:24.39">Now what you wanted, of course, was you wanted them to send a check.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:28:27.26">Yeah, of course. Or a money order or cash or anything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:28:32.74">Did you tell them not to do it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:28:37.71">Very subtly. I didn't want to hurt their feelings. They thought they were doing a great thing for the angel by sending these clothes. Yeah, I didn't want to hurt them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rico Lowry</h4><p begin="00:28:49.12">My dad would blazingly just-- he would have sidewalk sales-- lingerie and gifts and jewelry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:28:57.25">This is Don's son Rico Lowry.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rico Lowry</h4><p begin="00:28:59.37">And my dad would blazingly just-- he would be selling the lingerie on racks in front of the print shop.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:29:06.14">He would actually put up racks on the sidewalk in front of the print shop?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Rico Lowry</h4><p begin="00:29:08.75">Yep. Yep. My dad had a very sarcastic and wicked sense of humor.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:29:16.09">A local police officer told me men from all over the country started showing up in Moline asking where they could find the angels. If they found their way to the print shop, Don called the cops on them. Dumbfounded police tried to explain to the men that there was no Angel Vanessa, no retreat, no Chonda-Za. But occasionally, if Don was in the mood, he'd actually allow them to meet female employees whom he had asked to pose as angels in photos.</p><p begin="00:29:39.60">In time, Don even set up events for his most loyal members to meet the angels. He called them gatherings. At the gathering in Chicago, an advice columnist offered dating suggestions, a comedian told jokes, angels in yellow-green dresses leaped around onstage in an interpretive dance.</p><p begin="00:29:57.16">Jesse went to the Moline gathering. He was excited to finally meet Pamala. She looked just like she did in her pictures. In fact, she was one of Don's employees. And her name really was Pamala. She greeted Jesse warmly. But Jesse's excitement was tempered by the fact that there were a dozen other men at the gathering. Jesse was shocked to find that every man thought he was in a personal relationship with Pamala, too. They crowded around her, vying for her attention.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:30:25.59">And then that's when it dawned on me. And I said, hey, this is not what I thought it would be or anything, that it was a ripoff. Well, that was like getting a kick in the stomach. It was upsetting and everything. We sent all that money and this, that, and the other. And it wasn't what it was meant to be. It got you down to reality and stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:30:49.35">Jesse knew that Pamala liked music boxes, so he bought her an expensive one with a tiny record on it that played <i>When</i> <i>the</i> <i>Saints</i> <i>Go</i> <i>Marching</i> <i>In.</i> Pamala loved it. He said she stared at it and let the record play. It went on and on and on. The other men stood around them and looked at Jesse. They looked at Pamala, then back to Jesse. He liked that he was making them jealous.</p><p begin="00:31:18.75">Jesse didn't blame Pamala. He wasn't exactly sure how the scam worked, but he was sure that the woman standing before him was the same woman who wrote to him, that she was the one who had read his letters. The proof? Pamala's dog jumped into his lap.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:31:33.59">She jumped on my lap twice and everything. That really surprised Pamala and that. So I guess she smelled my scent on the letters I was writing to her and everything and stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:31:44.76">We got in touch with Pamala to see if she remembered any of this, but she declined to be interviewed on tape for the story. She did confirm that she hadn't written the letters.</p><p begin="00:31:53.59">Jesse made friends with a couple of other men at the meeting, particularly two guys named Lenny and Al. They were all like strangers who had independently watched the same soap opera for many years.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:32:03.67">When we got to talking about it, I said, well, why did you write on to this and everything? Instead of bonding with the girls, we ended up talking to each other and meeting new friends and talking about the troubles we had. Well, they were just like me and everything. So we stayed in correspondence like they said. They wrote me letters. And they even called me at my restaurant to ask me how things were going and everything and finding out, asking about my dad and everything. So that was encouraging to hear somebody calling to want to check on you and everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:32:38.09">In other words, they asked about all the personal stuff Pamala never asked about. Lenny and Al stayed in touch until they died.</p><p begin="00:32:52.96">What finally brought Don Lowry's scam to an end was a woman named Susan Rasso. She was a model that Don had worked with. She had gotten into a car crash and called Don for help. He showed up at the hospital with a photographer. They unbandaged her wounds and took pictures. They sent these to all the men who were corresponding with Angel Susan and asked them for help in paying her medical bills. But Don didn't give Susan the money. She went to the cops.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lieutenant Kenneth Rexroth</h4><p begin="00:33:20.31">And she came to our office. She revealed the promises Mr. Lowry had made to her and broken. The return that Mr. Lowry received was staggering in terms of dollars and cents.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:33:38.96">This is Lieutenant Kenneth Rexroth of the Moline Police Department. He had been aware of Don Lowry for years. He'd turned away many men who'd come to the police station in search of the angels. And he'd been looking for a way to lock Don up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lieutenant Kenneth Rexroth</h4><p begin="00:33:51.16">He was very diabolical. He's a sinister person. I consider Mr. Lowry to be an evil man.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:33:59.99">But thanks to Susan Rasso, the police finally had evidence to obtain subpoenas. They raided Don's print shop.</p><p begin="00:34:06.93">They found out that some men sold everything in order to give their life savings to the angels. One man lived out of his car and forwarded his social security check to his angel. When the police got in touch with these guys, many of them realized for the first time that their treasured letters were written by a man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Blanchard</h4><p begin="00:34:23.70">What I was turned out to be angry about and more embarrassed about-- more than anything-- was the fact that he was even involved-- any man at all was even involved.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:34:34.28">Again, this is Ken Blanchard, who spent years receiving letters from Angel Vanessa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ken Blanchard</h4><p begin="00:34:38.81">When I found out that these letters I had been getting all these times, and I thought was some girl sharing something with me, well, then I find out it was him writing the darn thing, I thought, my god, what the hell am I getting into? I can laugh about it now, but I think at the time I did have some feelings about that that weren't very charitable.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:35:08.18">Don's lawyer said that if members believed the angels were real, that was on them. As Don told me many years later--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:35:14.98">People believed what they wanted to believe. You cannot dissuade them. Most members believed the angels lived forever in a never-never-land called retreat. We told them they live forever. They never grew old. Does that tell you anything? Huh?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:35:34.36">Wait, you're surprised that they believed you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:35:35.88">Yeah. Yeah. And it helped them. I mean, it made them happy. So, big deal.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:35:44.05">Don and Pamala were charged with mail fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering. The press mobbed the trial. Don was shamed in the press, called a snake oil salesman at <i>People</i> magazine, which brings me back to what got me interested in the story in the first place, the thing that really surprised me.</p><p begin="00:36:00.56">Many members flew from all over the country to show up at the courthouse in defense of The Call. Some stood outside with picket signs, defending the brotherhood. Jesse and his friend Al were both there. As they waited outside the courtroom, Jesse saw Pamala come up. He rushed over to her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:36:16.89">She was walking up. And I noticed she was cold, so I took off my jacket and draped it over her shoulders. And we walked all the way up to the courthouse. I was like a security guard. And after she went indoors, I took my coat off and I backed off and everything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:36:35.16">Did she say anything to you at that point?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:36:38.32">No, not really.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:36:40.65">Members testified on the stand and said The Call had been a critical, beautiful part of their lives. One man said letters from the angels saved him from alcoholism and thoughts of suicide. And Jesse testified, too. This is him reading a court transcript of what he said on the stand.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:36:55.24">Well, it gave you, like I said, inspiration to continue no matter what the circumstances that you were going through, that if you preserved you could make it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:37:06.40">Do you remember saying this at the trial?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:37:09.96">Yes, I do.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:37:11.54">Would you say that you still stand by what you said at trial?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:37:16.23">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:37:18.14">So here's the thing, Jesse. Don Lowry lied to you and sent you letters on behalf of someone else for many years. And you formed an emotional connection with this woman who was writing to you. At the same time, you showed up at a trial to essentially defend Don Lowry. And I'm trying to understand how and why you did that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:37:41.82">Well, like I said before, it wasn't actually defending him, but it was actually Pamala that was the one that we were all-- we turned our attention to help her. And that meant helping Don also and everything.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:37:55.60">I understand that Don was really the mastermind of the operation, but when she showed up at these meetings and she presented herself as the same Pamala who was the Pamala in the letters, wasn't she lying to you?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:38:07.96">Well, I guess you could think about that that way, yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:38:13.39">Did you ever think about it that way?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:38:16.51">No, not until now and everything, when all of this has been re-brought out and everything.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:38:24.62">Don and Pamala were both found guilty. Pamala served two years in prison. Don was in prison for 10 years.</p><p begin="00:38:32.69">When I met Don, I asked him whether he felt he did anything wrong.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Don Lowry</h4><p begin="00:38:36.94">I think I did something very wrong. I suppose I made it a little bit too real. I did. I made it too real.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:38:48.61">Jesse lives alone now with his dog Chewbacca. He's in his 60s and is still single. He's had some complications from diabetes recently and had parts of his foot amputated. It hasn't been easy. My producer, Stephanie Foo, visited him at his house in Texas.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:39:03.19">I was in the hospital after my amputation, running around on my knee scooter. I said, you can still do this, keep going, and everything. So and I remember those words she told me. Get on your feet. So I do that and everything and keep going.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:39:16.68">Wow. Even now, even today.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:39:18.61">Even today and everything and stuff.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:39:22.05">But basically that line, "get on your feet," it doesn't really matter who wrote it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jesse</h4><p begin="00:39:28.85">No. You think back, but it brings back fond memories of way back when. And you could be in your hundreds and everything or older. And I hope to have this on my mind on down the line and everything and stuff.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Shankar Vedantam</h4><p begin="00:39:46.57">Jesse still has the little wooden lighthouse Pamala sent him. It's on his dresser in his bedroom. And he still has two photos of Pamala in his den-- one on the wall, one on his desk. In one, she's sitting in an office chair, hands in her lap. Not glamorous or sexy or anything. Jesse says she's just sitting there, being herself. It's just a little something to say, I made a friend.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:15.83">Shankar Vedantam.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:40:50.53"><i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass. Today's program, The Heart Wants What It Wants. What happens when you find that whether you like it or not, you're having feelings-- big feelings-- for somebody who is giving you signs that it really might not work out? We have arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, My Love is Blue.</p><p begin="00:41:08.22">Elsa Waithe is a stand-up comedian, young, recently moved to New York City. And last November, after the policeman who shot Michael Brown was not indicted for killing him, she felt like, OK, that is not right. And she decided to join the protesters who were out demonstrating about the decision and about police behavior.</p><p begin="00:41:26.24">And at her very first protest, this thing happened she did not expect. She got a very inconvenient crush on somebody she had no desire to have a crush on. And, of course, as we have heard this hour, that is something you cannot control.</p><p begin="00:41:37.46">She talked about this on stage in a storytelling show about crushes. We have a recording from that show that is a little janky, but it is totally audible with-- as you will hear-- a very enthusiastic audience.</p><p begin="00:41:48.09">If you're listening online or to the podcast of our program, I want to say before we start, we have unbeeped a few curse words here in this online version of the program. If you prefer the beeped version of our show-- maybe you're listening with little kids-- you can get that at thisamericanlife.org.</p><p begin="00:42:04.17">Anyway, here's Elsa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Elsa Waithe</h4><p begin="00:42:06.02">And so now once we get to Times Square, we've met up with other groups. And at this point, it's massive. So we spread across the intersection, and we all sit down. And sure enough, the riot cops step up. And the riot police all have the face masks-- the face guards.</p><p begin="00:42:23.77">And a part of their thing is to be very intimidating. And you can't see anybody's face. And they're really big. And it's just one sort of stormtrooper sort of thing of very scary police officers.</p><p begin="00:42:36.08">And at this point, you guys, I'm really nervous. I'm really scared because they've given a dispersal warning. And people are getting flustered. And people are starting to leave. And those of us who were sitting down, it's dwindled.</p><p begin="00:42:49.34">There's also lots of cameras here. So I've made my stand. I don't want to get up because people are going to see that. And I'm just trying to find a zen place. I'm just trying to look around and just find something to focus on.</p><p begin="00:43:07.67">And really all I'm seeing is my reflection in all of these face masks until I get to one officer who has not put her face mask down, you guys. And it was just the most angelic face. It was very delicate inside of this-- and it almost didn't seem like she even wanted to be there, you know? I was transfixed.</p><p begin="00:43:51.82">And the sergeant, he says, "line up." And I realized that they're lining up in front of who they're going to arrest. And she's lined up with me.</p><p begin="00:44:14.03">And he gives one more dispersal warning. He says, "you have 30 seconds to get out of the street. You are obstructing traffic. If you do not get out of the street, you are subject to arrest." And I says, well, her?</p><p begin="00:44:33.84">The sergeant gets on the megaphone and he says, "OK, that's it. Whoever's here, round them up." And so she leans in and she says, "you're going to have to come with me."</p><p begin="00:44:43.46">And I realize I'm being filmed. There's lots of cameras. Flash bulbs are going off everywhere. And so I wanted to be really thug and gangster about it. You know what I'm saying? I was like-- in my mind, I said, yeah, you're going to have to pick me up. But I think what actually came out was like, yeah, OK.</p><p begin="00:45:16.12">She picks me up. And she turns me around. And she goes to put the zip ties-- the flex cuffs-- on me. She put them on really tight, you guys. And I wanted to be upset, but I kind of liked it. I don't know.</p><p begin="00:45:39.29">And here's the thing, you guys. I was part of the first 10 people to be arrested in New York City in conjunction with these non-indictments. They were calling us the Times Square 10. My picture was everywhere. In the morning, when I woke up, it was on CNN, it was on Yahoo News. And so all my friends back home, they seen these pictures. And everyone's like, wow, you look really calm amongst all this chaos.</p><p begin="00:46:11.76">What was going through your mind? I wanted to tell people something really poignant. I was thinking about civil rights. And I was thinking about Dr. King. And I wanted to tell you that it was all those things, but really it was just like, holy shit, there's a lot of cameras. Her hands are soft. Gosh.</p><p begin="00:46:45.66">So they load us into the back of the paddy wagon. Unfortunately, she does not ride with us. But when we get to the precinct, now I'm reunited with my arresting officer because they have to take you through the booking process, OK?</p><p begin="00:46:57.54">And so then they take your mugshot. Now I'm ready for this. All the excitement from getting arrested has dissipated. And here's the real shit. I'm getting processed now. But you're partnered up with who arrested you. So I get her name now. And this is Officer Laura. All right, so now I have her name. And this is great.</p><p begin="00:47:18.15">So she's taking me through the fingerprinting process. And they have to take your hand. They do it for you. They take your hand. And she's holding my hand and pressing my fingers into the ink. And now we're making a finger picture. It's gorgeous. So this is our first piece of artwork together.</p><p begin="00:47:53.82">And now it's mugshot time, you guys, all right? It's time for the mugshot. Now I'm determined. I am going to take a gangster mugshot, OK? I know nothing about this says gangster, but I'm going to thug up and take this mugshot, right?</p><p begin="00:48:08.85">So we take it from the front. Boom. We take it from the side. Boom. And then, you guys, surprise, surprise, your arresting officer gets in the picture with you. And we get to take a picture together.</p><p begin="00:48:34.76">I was so excited. I was so strong in the first two pictures. And then she gets in for the third, and I'm just so amped I threw my thumb up. She didn't find that amusing. She slapped my ass. She's like, no gang signs.</p><p begin="00:48:57.13">Can I get a copy of this for Facebook? No one's going to believe me.</p><p begin="00:49:04.59">So, I mean, OK, so that's when all the fun stopped, you guys. They put me in the cell. I was in there for eight and a half hours. But I left in the morning. I wasn't tired. I wasn't upset. I just had like butterflies, cherubs, rainbows, unicorns. I wonder if I'll ever see her again.</p><p begin="00:49:27.08">But I finally got the gumption to go back out. And I was like, I'm not going to let this silence me. I'm not going to let this scare me. And I had some down time. Let me go back out.</p><p begin="00:49:37.01">And so I went back out-- no friends, nobody. I didn't tell anybody I was back out. I went back to Times Square. And I was out there, taking laps around Times Square with signs, waiting for the crowd to get bigger.</p><p begin="00:49:47.82">And, you guys, I see what appears to be Officer Laura. And you got to understand, I'm with some really anti-police people. So you really can't say shit to the cops, right?</p><p begin="00:50:04.28">But I my eye upon her. And I was like, "Officer Laura." And she turned around, and it was her. And I couldn't contain my excitement. I was like, "oh, my god, it's so good to see you!"</p><p begin="00:50:24.39">And I gave her a hug, which didn't win me points from anybody because the protesters weren't happy and neither were the police. And Officer Laura didn't remember me, you guys. So fuck the police! All right.</p><p begin="00:50:46.76">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:50:52.67">Elsa Waithe.

  <h3>Act Three. Unbreak My Heart.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:07.80">Act Three, Unbreak My Heart. So this last story starts in exactly the way you would expect if you're even half paying attention to today's program.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:51:15.82">I definitely 100% thought he was the one.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:19.27">That's Julia. A few years back, when she was in her 20s, she dated this guy who lived in England. She lives in Los Angeles. She loved thinking about marrying him and moving to England and raising little babies with British accents who would call her "mummy." And then one day she was at work.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:51:33.46">And we were on Skype, not the video Skype, but the chat Skype, just typing to each other, like instant messenger.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:51:40.83">And he dumped her. Not even on video. He text dumped her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:51:45.64">And it really took me by surprise. He wrote, "this isn't working for me." And I thought he meant his computer or something. I had no idea he was talking about our entire relationship.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:02.73">Well, the wording leaves it vague, to be fair. The wording's very vague.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:52:06.15">Yeah, I agree.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:14.26">She couldn't concentrate on work anymore. Her life was wrecked. No more babies calling her "mummy" in the future. And as she drove home, sitting in traffic--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:52:22.21">I called 1-800-Expedia. And I bought a one-way ticket to England that left in six hours.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:52:29.89">Maybe you should explain your thinking here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:52:32.56">I really thought, OK, I'm going to make this big, grand gesture. I'm a big romcom fan. And I felt like this was my romcom moment in life. What would Bridget Jones do? You know what she would do? She would go to England right away.</p><p begin="00:52:47.34">So that was the plan. I thought I'd show up at his house. It'd be a surprise. And he'll see me and our eyes will lock. And if he sees me, he'll remember we're perfect for each other and we should get married.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:04.95">So packs a bag-- overpacks actually because who knows how long she'll be staying? Maybe the rest of her life-- lands in England, gets off the plane. And it hits her.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:53:16.47">As I'm in the customs line, I start crying and a little bit freaking out. Like, what am I doing? And I think that was the first time I started thinking, what if it doesn't go as I think it'll go, you know?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:28.88">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:53:30.17">When he sees me, he won't say, "you're the one."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:34.45">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:53:35.50">So I started crying. I get to the front, and I approach this customs agent, who was this adorable, little British guy. He was maybe 20.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:47.21">He asks her, how long are you going to be in the country? Standard question, but this sets off a huge crying jag because, of course, that is the biggest question in her whole life at this moment. The answer depends entirely on the boyfriend. She spills the whole story to the British customs agent.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia Lillis</h4><p begin="00:54:01.69">The whole story. The whole plan. My boyfriend dumped me on Skype yesterday. I bought a one-way ticket to England. I'm going to surprise him. And I told him, but he's the one. He just forgets I'm the one.</p><p begin="00:54:14.31">And I looked at him, and I'm like, is that crazy? And I swear to you, Ira, he looked me straight in the eye and with this adorable little British accent, he says, "you got to do what you got to do for love," which I thought was like, yeah, he's right.</p><p begin="00:54:34.91">I mean, come on, that's straight out of a romantic comedy, right? This little British guy telling me this life advice. And I really thought at that moment, I am doing what I got to do for love. That's what I'm doing right now. And I'm going to end up with the guy.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:52.87">It's a sign.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:54:54.24">Right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:58.93">She did not end up with the guy. It turns out booking a one-way flight to another country and then traveling the same day you bought the ticket and then crying the entire time you're in the customs line-- pretty suspicious behavior for an international traveler. And other customs agents put her into detention for a while and then called the boyfriend to see if this unlikely story was true, not caring at all about how they were ruining the element of surprise in her plan-- a key element.</p><p begin="00:55:22.03">In the end, she takes a sad bus ride to see the boyfriend. When he sees her, he does not propose. He tells her, no, you are not the one. She flies home the next morning.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:32.77">Can I ask you-- when you look back on this, the thing that the British customs agent said to you-- what was the line again?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:55:39.93">He said, "you got to do what you got to do for love."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:44.55">Do you think he's right in retrospect?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:55:49.58">I think-- yeah, I think he's right. And I'm glad I did what I thought I had to do for love because it really put the nail in the coffin on that relationship.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:02.29">Wait, you think you did the right thing even though you also think, with a distance of years, that it was crazy?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:56:11.39">It was crazy. Don't get me wrong. But if I hadn't done all of this-- I don't know. It would feel a little open-ended.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:21.20">It's so interesting that this is what you're saying to me because we began this week's show with a 76-year-old man who, on Sunday, is flying across the country to tell this woman that he has feelings for her and to see if she has feelings for him. And he kind of knows, I think, in the back of his mind that it's probably doomed, and he can't stop himself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:56:45.46">Well, he's got to do it, though, right? He's got to do what he's got to do for love, Ira.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:50.64">No, I agree. I think like you're saying. It's kind of a little bit of a joke, but I think he actually does. I think that that's the truth.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:56:56.95">Yeah. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:58.74">If you had any advice for him, what would you say to him if you could send a message to him right now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:57:07.64">It's funny because I wouldn't even say-- you don't want to prepare yourself for the worst because that's just going into it having a bad attitude. I think the way I went into it-- going into it really thinking like, this is going to happen, this is my life, and this is how it works out-- I think that's the best way to go into it. And then just deal with whatever fallout happens.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:47.15">Julia Lillis. She now has a baby who calls her mommy and a second one on the way and a husband who does not have a British accent, but apparently has other good qualities to compensate.</p><p begin="00:57:57.51"/><p begin="00:58:19.23">Our program was produced today by Zoe Chace, Robyn Semien, and me, with Sean Cole, Neil Drumming, Stephanie Foo, Chana Joffe-Walt, Miki Meek, Jonathan Menjivar, Alissa Shipp, and Nancy Updike.
