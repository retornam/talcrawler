And she told her dad that when kids at school talked about going on roller coasters and which ones they'd ridden and how awesome they are, she always felt kind of dumb because she was so scared of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tess Carlson</h4><p begin="00:00:31.87">My dad was like, let's go there sometime so you can conquer your fear. And at first, I thought he was joking or he was crazy or something.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:40.74">He wasn't, of course. And he made this recording of the trip that I heard on this podcast called <i>UnFictional</i> that I want to play you some of now because this recording's great. Her dad's Bob Carlson, who hosts that show, <i>UnFictional.</i></p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tess Carlson</h4><p begin="00:00:52.26">Magic Mountain Parkway.

And they start with the easy roller coasters, right? They'd watched videos of the ones they would go on to prepare. And so after they do the Roadrunner Express and the Gold Rusher, they advance to the Ninja, which turns you sideways. And then they came to the big challenge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bob Carlson</h4><p begin="00:01:17.71">All right. Next stop, Revolution, Tess's first looping roller coaster.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:21.69">So they approach this huge, frightening-looking steel contraption. Can I just say that looping is a fantastically bland way to describe what this thing does. It is an enormous loop, nine stories high, like a giant Hot Wheels loop that flips you totally upside down.

OK.</p><p begin="00:03:35.28">So Anthony DeVito recently observed his grandmother go through this metamorphosis that he and really nobody in the family imagined they would ever see. Anthony is a stand-up comedian. And he explains what happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:03:46.16">My grandmother Vicki is 90 years old. She lives in a nursing home. And lately, she can't stop talking about her new boyfriend Frank. They're very much in love. And their dialogue is straight out of a romantic comedy. I mean, this is what it sounds like when they're drinking tea.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:04:00.01">Have enough sugar.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank</h4><p begin="00:04:01.80">Not as sweet as you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:04:03.92">Ha, ha, ha. You are one of a kind, you are. Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank</h4><p begin="00:04:09.38">And I also told you, they broke the mold.</p><p begin="00:04:12.24">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:04:14.59">That's the way Frank talks. He's like an encyclopedia of love cliches, but totally sincere about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:04:20.94">What do you want to, hun?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank</h4><p begin="00:04:23.04">Stay close to you, gorgeous.</p><p begin="00:04:24.14">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank</h4><p begin="00:04:25.60">I've been in love before, but never like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:04:28.10">Yes. That's how I go to sleep at night, with those words in my ear.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:04:34.48">Again, Grandma's 90. Frank's 62, which makes him 28 years younger than my grandma. That's not even a cougar. That's a different animal. It's like a water buffalo.</p><p begin="00:04:45.16">Also, she's partially deaf, while Frank is blind. He's got one leg. And it's an interracial relationship. As a stand-up comedian, I've never felt more pressure to write a joke.</p><p begin="00:04:59.64">This is in no way the grandma who raised me. She's not a love-struck, soft-hearted kind of girl. She's a tough Italian lady from New Jersey, right out of central casting. If you've ever seen a mob movie in the last 30 years, you got the picture.</p><p begin="00:05:13.22">Her eyebrows are drawn on, but not at the appropriate height. So she always look shocked. It's all there, the opinions, the accent, and, yeah, even the racism. So a relationship with a blind, one-legged black guy? Not the thing you'd expect from Grandma.</p><p begin="00:05:29.83">And yet, none of that's the most surprising part. What's most surprising is that she has anything to do with a man at all. The grandma I've always known? She despised men. Like she was fundamentally against them as a concept. So all this lovey-dovey Frank business? It's like she's been inhabited by an alien.</p><p begin="00:05:56.78">In order to understand how opposed my grandma was to men, I need to tell you the very weird story of the tenant who lived with my family when I was growing up. This was in Bloomfield, New Jersey. My dad died a car crash when I was a baby. So my mom and I moved in with my aunt, grandma, and great grandma. We lived in a two-story house with a basement. Each floor had a different set of women.</p><p begin="00:06:20.49">The only other guy in the house besides me was our tenant John. He rented out our living room. John was always there, lying on the rug, shirtless, in black sweatpants, eating waffles, and watching animal shows.</p><p begin="00:06:34.78">My grandma didn't like John. She treated him like a second-class citizen. Whenever she walked through the living room, she'd look at him and grunt. She was fixated on keeping him away from all our food. I'd open the fridge, and there'd be stickers on everything there-- milk, cold cuts, leftover pasta. They all said, "Not for John."</p><p begin="00:06:55.54">Then one day I thought I overheard my aunt saying John and Grandma Vicki were married. And I'm like, what?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:02.25">And you said to me, John is married to Grandma Vicki? That's her husband?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:08.02">That's my mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:09.24">(LAUGHING) I was like, yeah. Who did you think he was? You actually didn't know that they were married.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:15.36">No, I didn't know they we're married. You know why? Because nobody told me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:20.95">Why did you tell me he was the tenant?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:23.83">I only said it maybe one time because that was a joke to us. They weren't a happy couple any longer. But I didn't know-- realize that you gave it a category in your head like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:37.50">Nobody ever--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:38.11">I was shocked when you said that to me because how could you not figure that out. He was our father.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:44.82">Because he lived in the living room, and nobody ever called him, this is my father. Or this is-- this is my grandfather. No one ever said that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:53.64">Right. It didn't hurt you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:07:56.49">No, it didn't hurt me. But that is weird to just one day be like, oh, the tenant is my grandfather.</p><p begin="00:08:02.44">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:04.19">Since you put it that way.</p><p begin="00:08:05.84">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:08:07.76"/></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:17.38">So how many years just about was he living there before, you know, he eventually gets kicked out or whatever?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:25.92">Um, I don't know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:28.29">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:28.74">It's-- it's so far back.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:30.25">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:30.58">And plus, when I don't like something, I block it out. So I can remember some of it. But if I don't want to remember it, it's gone. It goes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:39.40">(LAUGHING) OK. OK. All right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:41.48">That's how I am.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:42.34">But how long-- just approximate-- from when he moves into the living room till he gets out of the house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:48.37">15 years.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:49.08">About 15 years?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:50.01">Yeah. Mhm.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:50.81">That is insane. 15 years he lived--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:53.08">It was bizarre.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:08:53.83">--in the living-- yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:08:55.56">I'm 33 now. Two and a half decades have passed since I learned that John was my grandpa. And you know what? This conversation that you're hearing right now? This is the first time my mom and I have ever talked about it since that day when I was eight.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:09:11.00">There were so many lies happening in the house at one time. Do you know what I mean? Because nobody was just saying what was going on. It was like a corrupt government or something. Like, I don't even know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:09:23.50">It seemed normal to us. Whatever the situation is, you want to make it seem as normal as it can be.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:09:31.70">Think about that for a second, what that says about my family's aggressive lack of interest in processing feelings. So being a DeVito, I learned John was my grandpa. And then I didn't change anything about my behavior at all towards him. And he didn't act any different with me either. He stayed the tenant.</p><p begin="00:09:54.80">Here's how my grandpa ended up in the doghouse. One day, years before I was born, Grandma goes out to move Grandpa's car in the driveway. She pulls down the sun visor.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:10:05.11">And all these envelopes fell on me. Oh, I said, what that heck? These are apartments that he rented, that he-- I don't want to really go into this crap. Not now. And I don't want to remember.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:10:21.12">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:10:21.68">I really don't.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:10:22.54">I gotcha.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:10:23.27">My mom filled me in on the details my grandma couldn't bring herself to say. The envelopes contained pictures of Grandpa with another woman, the one he was renting secret apartments for. For Grandma, the marriage was over. But Grandpa John refused to move out because he always denied ever having an affair. And Grandma never filed for divorce because she didn't have the money to move herself and four kids. There was a total standoff in the house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:10:51.24">So then he took upon himself to sleep on the floor in the living room because he was never going to sleep in my bedroom.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:10:59.49">Right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:10:59.93">Uh-huh.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:11:01.23">Did he ever want to get back together or try to win you back in anyway?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:11:04.38">No. No, I don't think so because I knew he thought it was hopeless because what he did was more than I can ever understand.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:11:16.38">So did you guys establish any ground rules between the two of you, places he was allowed to go? Did you talk at all?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:11:22.81">No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:11:23.22">Because you were in the same house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:11:23.87">No. Never.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:11:25.56">No?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:11:26.04">No. We never. He only came in late at night. Then he'd be gone in the morning. You know, so we didn't connect. No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:11:36.06">I remember all the food in the fridge was marked "Not for John."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:11:40.08">Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, because I felt I wasn't going to pay to feed the bum.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:11:45.76">Would you just, in your head, just pretend he wasn't there?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:11:48.64">Yeah. You have to. What are you going to do? Do you think I'm-- he's not worth me going to the crazy house for. No way. Uh-huh. No way.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:12:00.37">They hadn't always been unhappy. She says he was this charming, funny guy who loved to dance and bought her beautiful gifts-- rings, necklaces, a blue fox fur coat. They had four daughters together. Big family dinners every night. Vacations at the Jersey Shore. It was nice.</p><p begin="00:12:19.81">But now she ignored him. She chose not to recognize her husband sleeping under the same roof. She never explained to my mom or sisters why their dad had moved into the living room. So sometimes they'd sneak him a plate of food or give him some extra money.</p><p begin="00:12:35.70">Finally, when I was in seventh grade, they forced him out. My aunts and great grandma were fed up he wasn't helping with the mortgage. I never saw him again. And soon after, he died of a heart attack. When my grandma heard the news, she was blank, absolutely no emotion. He'd already been dead to her for years.</p><p begin="00:13:03.31">There were some other guys who tried with Grandma-- I mean, really tried, seriously courted her. First there was Mr. Bill, our fix-it man, He'd always try to kiss her, and she'd wiggle out of there. Then there was Gene, a school crossing guard. He wanted to marry her and proclaimed his love over and over.</p><p begin="00:13:23.02">And her? There's no other way to say it. She took huge pleasure in turning them down. It was the one activity that gave her pure joy.</p><p begin="00:13:32.55">It was hard to watch. I was in high school then. And I feel bad for Gene. I wanted to pull him aside and be like, dude, just walk away. You're a crossing guard. You, of all people, should know when to stop.</p><p begin="00:13:44.94">I remember he used to leave these sobbing voice mails, private outpourings of emotion. And Grandma would play them for me, laughing, while she'd clean the kitchen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:13:54.50">Gene would call up, like crying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:13:56.25">Oh, yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:13:56.65">(LAUGHING) Do you remember that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:13:58.17">Yeah, huh.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:13:59.41">(IMITATING GENE) Vicki, Vicki, I love you. Vicki, I miss you. Vicki, I want to marry you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:14:06.18">That's enough. Oh, he was unbelievable. I didn't need that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:14:11.22">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:14:11.97">I don't need you in my life.

I always took it as-- I don't know. I guess you were more guarded. Or they were paying for what Grandpa did. Do you know what I mean? Whereas, like, he wrongs you. He cheated on you. He hurt you so bad that, like, you wouldn't open up to them because of that. Is that accurate at all or no?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:14:41.11">I lost a lot of trust in men, huh?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:14:42.98">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:14:45.18">Well.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:14:53.90">So when my mom walked into the nursing home one day, and she saw this guy pulled up next to my grandma in his wheelchair, needless to say, she was surprised.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mother Devito</h4><p begin="00:15:03.35">And she introduced me to Frank to say that's her boyfriend. And they found one another.

I thought I was hearing things. So I said, how nice. Nice to meet you.</p><p begin="00:15:21.37">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:15:21.87">Yeah. Nothing else to say. I just tried to hide my surprise because I was, like, startled, wondering what frame of mind she was in.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:15:34.87">My mom wondered if she messed up her medication. No, really, she worried about that. We all did. Since then, it's been an adjustment, the thought that Grandma could ever have feelings for a man.</p><p begin="00:15:53.81">My grandma moved into the nursing home for health reasons a year ago. And it was brutal, the way those things often are. She'd been living with my mom and my aunt. Their life at home was so close, everyone sitting around the table, up in each other's business, in a good way, every day. There were always multiple conversations happening at the same time. You jump in and out of them like double-dutch.</p><p begin="00:16:15.44">And Grandma was the center of it all. She held court. Her laugh would fill the room. Now she was alone. And she hated it. She didn't talk to anyone, wouldn't leave her room for months. Every time we visited her, she begged for us to take her home. That is, until she met Frank.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:16:32.73">Frank was walking toward me. And he said hello. And then he says, what's your name? I'm Frank. And then I said-- I told my name. Then I find out this guy is blind, totally blind. I felt very bad. And I told them, if there's anything that you need or you want me to-- you know, just don't hesitate. Let me know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank</h4><p begin="00:17:03.35">And I asked her not to let me fall.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:17:05.97">My grandma had wheeled up to him and held out her right arm. Frank had lost his leg and was struggling to make it down the hallway. That day he was wearing a prosthetic leg and using a cane.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank</h4><p begin="00:17:16.70">Your grandmother'd hold me on one side. And she said, I won't let you fall. She says, she's going to be my eyes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:17:24.50">After that, my grandma always sat next to Frank in the cafeteria.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Frank</h4><p begin="00:17:28.22">She used to take charge. She would tell me my juice is here, whatever I'm, you know, getting ready to consume is here on the left, on my right.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Anthony Devito</h4><p begin="00:17:38.83">I see them do this all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Vicki</h4><p begin="00:17:40.47">Wait, hun.

Frank can't see anything, so Grandma gives him the play-by-play. They talk about what life was like on the outside. She loved a beer at the end of a long day. For Frank, it was rum and Coke.</p><p begin="00:18:16.71">Frank told my grandma he used to work at a factory wrapping products in plastic. And like her, he was married and had his heart broken. He said his wife fell in love and left him for another man. Then he lost his eyesight to macular degeneration, then his leg to blood clots.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:21:54.50">Act Two, Streetwise. So most big, grand transformations we go through really come down to, like, 100 little things that we change one by one about ourselves, which is why a woman I'm going to call M is riding the bus.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:22:09.75">This is my first time. I have never ever used this bus pass. And the bus system, I heard, is terrible. But let's see. I think we have to cross.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:22:20.19">Monday of this week, she rode a bus as the next of those many steps that she has to do to become an American. She's from Afghanistan, but she lives in Detroit now. There are currently a record number of people-- 60 million, according to the United Nations-- displaced by violence and persecution, and needed to start all over elsewhere, change their lives, transform themselves. M is one of them.</p><p begin="00:22:39.97">She's right now living in a temporary home for asylum seekers called Freedom House. And at Freedom House, they've taught her how to put together an American-style resume, how to go to the doctor in America. Today's lesson is how to get around the city independently.</p><p begin="00:22:51.34">This turns out to be one of the most critical skills if you're going to get a job or really do much of anything in this country, right? And the Detroit buses are chronically late and confusing. And in the past, other Freedom House refugees have gotten lost for hours when they've been sent out on the very first bus ride.</p><p begin="00:23:08.32">One of them circled around and around and around on the route, not getting off until finally the driver asked where the guy was going and then drove the bus to Freedom House, which  was actually a couple blocks away from the route, to drop the guy off. Since then, to minimize mishaps, usually a volunteer goes with. And because I wanted to record this, Freedom House decided not to send a volunteer. They informed me when I arrived basically I would be the volunteer.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:23:33.24">I have you with me, so I'm not afraid that I will be lost.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:23:37.99">Unfortunately for both of us-- well, mostly unfortunately for her-- I've never ridden a bus in Detroit.

Then we have to change and take another bus, bus number 125.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:00.34">So wait. So we get off here and then we walk to here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:24:02.31">Yeah, no, no, no.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:02.93">Is that what that means?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:24:03.62">No, no, no.

This is the bus.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:06.84">We're heading to southwest Detroit, to a neighborhood called Lincoln Park, to an apartment complex called Indian Village Apartments as just practice reaching a destination. We ride the number 19 bus for over half an hour.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:24:17.83">We have to get off here?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bus Driver 1</h4><p begin="00:24:19.20">Yeah, this is the last stop.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:24:19.90">Thank you so much.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:24:21.16">Thank you so much.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:24:22.31">We're supposed to transfer to another bus, but it's not so clear where we're supposed to do that. This is a moment that sometimes trips up other refugees, the transfer points, because they're afraid to approach strangers and ask for help. M does not pause. She sees two young guys sitting on a railing at a convenience store in front of a shiny black Mustang and strides purposefully up to them. She's not very tall, 40-ish, wears square-ish glasses and hijab, a scarf covering her head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:24:47.71">Excuse me, I'm going to this area, Indian Village Apartments.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man On Street</h4><p begin="00:24:53.77">Baby, what's your problem?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:24:54.15">I have to get bus number 125.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man On Street</h4><p begin="00:24:57.13">125?

In other words, figuring out how to ride a bus is child's play to her. She's a college grad with a bachelor's in business administration. Back home in Kabul, did project management for an international organization, humanitarian projects.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:25:55.36">I was responsible, for example, to make need assessments, and then to check every stage of that project with the implementing partner.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:26:05.52">It's not unusual, of course, for this immigrant who's used to a job in her own country managing things and doing PowerPoint presentations and looking at Excel spreadsheets is hoping here in America that she'll get work as a seamstress, if she's lucky. She got her papers to work legally a month ago. And looking for work so far has landed nothing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bus Driver 2</h4><p begin="00:26:23.38">OK, these two cards?

The driver tells M that he's just filling in. So he can't help us. He doesn't know the stops. There's an automated system that calls out the stops as the bus approaches each one.

That's why she has an American with her. I pull the cord. You know, she doesn't even know the English word for cord yet. She knows rope, sure. But cord, that's a more subtle one. She hasn't heard that one yet.

Because learning to do concrete tasks like using a bus transfer, that is not the hard part of turning herself from an Afghan into an American.</p><p begin="00:28:12.97">The hard part is that M is here alone. She came here for a conference a year ago. But while she was here, word got to her that certain people back home did not like what she was doing, working and traveling with foreigners. And if she came back, she and her family could be killed. That's, by the way, why I'm not saying her name.</p><p begin="00:28:29.41">So she's been apart from her children and her husband for over a year. The youngest don't even know where. They think she's in Afghanistan because it would be dangerous if they would blab to people that she's in America.</p><p begin="00:28:40.01">The oldest are teenagers. The littlest is now just three. Last time she saw him he was two. And he doesn't recognize her, has no idea who she is when she talks to him on Skype. And the others?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:28:50.97">Yeah, of course, they're asking me, when are you coming back? And so I just tell them, I don't know when. For me, it's very difficult because I have never been away from my children. And I was very active-- work, I was mom for my children. But here, I'm kind of idle, you know? Staying at home and doing nothing.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:20.48">Oh, right, of course, you were busy every second before.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>M</h4><p begin="00:29:24.44">But I hope that I will find job soon.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:29:28.97">It can take years to get asylum in the United States. The system's been especially backed up recently because of the flood of children coming in from Latin America. M used to have control over her life. And now the most important thing to her in the world-- getting to bring her family here-- is on a timeline she cannot predict or control, and really might take four or five years. The three-year-old could be eight. And he's not doing well as it is. He's acting up. He's a handful for is dad.</p><p begin="00:29:54.81">But today, the sun's shining. It's unseasonably warm.

    <div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:31:26.44">Richard Pierce caught my attention the moment I met him. Rich is a prisoner at the Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility way up by the Canadian border, the north country, people call it. He's unusually open, way more than most prisoners.</p><p begin="00:31:40.13">There's a good chance he's going to be released next year. And he talks frankly about how much that scares him. But he's trying to prepare himself for that moment by joining a club called Toastmasters.</p><p begin="00:31:52.18">At Toastmasters, people give speeches. Here in the prison, it's supposed to help inmates learn how to speak when they're in front of the parole board or in a job interview, say. And he needs to practice because for years in prison, Rich said nothing to no one. He worked out alone, walked the yard alone, ate in the chow hall alone. Even for prison, Rich was weirdly quiet. No conversation, no give-and-take, he was a ghost in a green uniform.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:32:20.75">Because that's a good way to do time.

I can't-- well, when you're told bad things so many times, over and over and over, and you're getting hit and you're getting beat, and you can't get out of house, you can't go nowhere, when you finally get out, it's such a release just to throw things on the fire and watch it get bigger and bigger and bigger until it consumes everything.</p><p begin="00:35:45.45">And it felt like what it was consuming, it was consuming everything inside me so I didn't have to deal with it anymore. And the bigger they were, the more things it consumed out of me. Because when I walked away, even though I smelled like smoke, I felt so much better. I was ready to take on anything life had for me after that, you know? Whereas the day before that, I couldn't take another thing. I just couldn't bear another thing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:36:12.92">He burned up a bulldozer and got arrested. He burned down a vacant restaurant and got arrested again. But his big crime happened on July 17, 2000. He'd been released from prison just 45 days earlier. Rich burned down a restaurant and a big condominium building near a ski resort. He was sentenced to up to 60 years in prison.</p><p begin="00:36:34.53">He earned parole in 2010 on one of his two arson charges. And he knew he'd come up for parole on the other arson charge five years later. That's when Rich decided he couldn't be alone anymore.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:36:45.23">I said, five years. That's right around the corner. I got 10 years in there already. [BLEEP] I might get out after all. It's only, you know, one more president away. [BLEEP] What am I going to do? Where am I going to live? Where am I going to work?</p><p begin="00:36:59.13">I'm going to be real pretty soon. I can't just, like, not talk to people anymore. I can't be isolated anymore. And that's when the realization hit me that I need to start practicing.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:37:10.47">He joined the prison chess club. He began eating with others, forced himself to do it. And the prison psychologists-- the mental gals, Rich calls them-- gave him a challenge. Speak to three people-- three-- in a single day. One morning, Rich woke up, got dressed, and approached a total stranger on the cell block thinking, OK, I'll try.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:37:32.97">I said, hey, uh, mind if I sit down for a minute? And he looked up at me really quizzical. He says, "I've been on this pod six months, and that is the first time I ever heard you speak." That's like a slap in the face, like it's a realization there how isolated you really are. I mean, it's a pod with 70 people. It's like a fishbowl. You're all intermingling. How can you go that long without even hearing your voice?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:37:56.67">And how long did you sit there talking with him for?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:37:59.50">Oh, about 10 or 15 minutes. You know, "where you from? What do you do for work? How long you here?" You know, things like that. "I'm from Littleton." "Where's that at?" "Oh, it's right around here. Oh, is it near woods? I like the pond, or this or that? Oh, yeah, yeah. There's these trails on the east lake and, you know, some other small talk."</p><p begin="00:38:19.97">But as I'm talking, I realize-- and this isn't nowhere near as difficult as I thought it would be-- and maybe the mental gals are on to something. Because if I can do this here, people don't know they are experiments that I'm practicing for freedom. They just think, you know, it's a normal conversation. But to me, it's a lot more. It's like practices.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:38:39.71">Rich was on the hunt now for two more people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:38:42.22">I gotta find a communication victim. I look over and see somebody by himself, aha. He's going to be my experiment.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:38:49.51">He found victim number two working out. They talked about push-ups and pull-ups-- guy stuff. He cornered victim number three on the basketball court, ended up playing hoops for a while. And when the day was over, Rich figured he'd spoken for 45 minutes, a Richard Pierce record.</p><p begin="00:39:11.85">The mental gals, the chess, these conversations, they were working. But none of them prepared Rich for Toastmasters-- the key, he thought, to real change. Because, of course, in Toastmasters, he couldn't just sit there. He had to talk.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:39:26.74">They said, you want to do an ice-breaker speech? And I'm like, ice-breaker speech? Uh, what are you talking about, ice-breaker speech? That's how freaked out I was, just right then and there.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:39:35.64">Your hands are trembling.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:39:36.79">Yes. And the anxiety came that quick. I'm like, OK. If I think I'm just going to get up there, I'm going to fall over and die. I'm going to have a heart attack. I'm going to fall over and die. That's what's going to happen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:39:49.78">You really thought you would die.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:39:51.82">Well, that was my first thought. Get up, and your heart's going to burst. And you're gonna die.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Toastmaster Host</h4><p begin="00:39:57.04">OK, onto the speaking portion of our program tonight.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:40:01.72">Rich, of course, didn't die that night. Or the night after that. He's been coming to Toastmasters for a few months now, slowly building up the courage to speak and the skills to do it. I was at the meeting the night he got up and gave a speech for the second time. He was introduced by another prisoner.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Toastmaster Host</h4><p begin="00:40:18.66">Speaker number one, title to his speech is "Yet another reason why it's not a good idea to dress up as a police officer."</p><p begin="00:40:27.44">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:40:30.13">Mr. Pierce, welcome.</p><p begin="00:40:31.82">[APPLAUSE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:40:34.62">Rich's assignment tonight was get to the point. Give a well-structured speech in five to seven minutes. Rich chose to talk about the time 30 years ago he decided to dress up as a cop for Halloween.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:40:46.54">And I looked at myself in the mirror. And I was quite impressed. I was confident I would scare the wits out of my friends and my coworkers. What could go wrong? [CHUCKLING]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:40:56.94">Watching him talk, I just didn't want him to fail. Here was Rich, standing in front of a dozen people, palms placed flat on the podium.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:41:04.75">And she says, hey, I got a great idea. Her face brightens. How about if you was to stick your hand-- uh-- point your uh-- [FINGER SNAPPING] um--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:41:15.85">He's lost his place, snapping his fingers, trying to remember the words.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:41:20.38">Point your, uh-- [FINGER SNAPPING] cap guns at me. And I'll raise my hands, and I'll give you the cash out of the drawer. Wouldn't that be a gas, she says.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:41:28.54">He recovered. Then his story wandered a little. But he got a lot of laughs. He connected with the room-- a real victory.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:41:36.60">The end.</p><p begin="00:41:37.21">[APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:41:39.18"/></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:41:47.07">After the speech, Rich was really hard on himself. In his self-evaluation, he wrote down three words-- horrible, needs practice. But his peers were more forgiving. Excellent job, they wrote. Great progress. Very good eye contact. Very welcoming. They called him winning and funny.</p><p begin="00:42:05.79">One inmate said they should have storytelling every Saturday night on the cell block with Mr. Pierce. Another told Rich he had nothing to fear. He was just as good as anyone else. Rich had been nervous, trembling even. And no one noticed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:42:21.54">So my insides don't match up my outsides. That's probably true for many people, don't you think?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:42:26.84">I do, actually. And that way, it's very, very normal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:42:29.78">Yeah, so that's comforting, that I can always portray myself as confident when I'm not. Until it comes naturally, anyway.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:42:36.72">I got news for you, Rich. A lot of people on the outside, a lot of quote, unquote "real people," they do that all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:42:43.09">Really?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:42:44.50">Absolutely.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:42:45.96">How do you know? Are you sure?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:42:48.59">I'm quite sure. People put on airs all the time. People often will act like they're more confident than they really are. It's normal.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Richard Pierce</h4><p begin="00:42:58.15">Yeah, I suppose so. I suppose so. Well, that's comforting to know, that I'm not like a total washout.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Keith O'brien</h4><p begin="00:43:06.95">No, he's not. He doesn't accept it, but it's true. He's way more normal than he thinks.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:24.89">Keith O'Brien in New Hampshire. Rich comes up for parole next summer.

  <h3>Act Four. Trailbreaker.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:34.96">Act Four, Trailbreaker. So it's not just that deciding to change your life can be completely momentous. Telling people about the decision can be a big deal, too. Sean Cole has an example.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:43:47.13">The beginning of this story is as ordinary as you can imagine. A kid comes out to his family during Thanksgiving break from college. The kid was Andy Greer. It was 1989. He said it like this.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:43:58.33">Mom and Dad, I'm sure it won't surprise you, but I'm gay. And I'm really happy about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:44:05.63">His mom, indeed, was not surprised. His father, he remembers, was very surprised, which was kind of amazing given all of the years Andy spent at musical theater camp.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:44:14.74">Well, of course, he'd thought about it. I later discovered a book in my house called <i>Growing</i> <i>Up</i> <i>Straight</i> that had all these rules underlined about how to bring up your child.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:44:24.40">Wait, it was how to bring up your child as a straight child?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:44:27.47">Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was things like take them camping at civil war sites and collect arrowheads. And I'm like, oh, I remember doing that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:44:35.28">That seems very particular.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:44:37.03">Yes, it was really particular. Yeah. Play mumblety-peg was one of this.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:44:41.96">What is mumblety-peg?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:44:43.04">It's where you throw knives at, like, a stump.</p><p begin="00:44:44.12">[LAUGHTER]</p><p begin="00:44:47.56">Which we did that. Yeah. That was fun.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:44:49.40">How is that supposed to straighten you--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:44:51.06">It doesn't seem like even the wrist movement would be helpful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:44:59.26">Andy says that night he announced the mumblety-peg hadn't worked, his dad responded with, "I have to think about this a while." And then Andy did what you do in 1989 suburban Maryland when you've just come out to your parents. He drove to the mall and wandered in and out of stores, thinking about what just happened. And when he got back to the parking lot, he realized he'd locked his keys in the car, his mom's car that he borrowed in order to drive off in a strident blaze of glory.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:45:25.00">Because I was, like, ran out of the house like I'd won this round. So I found a payphone. It's 1989, right? So called my mom, mortified. And I thought, well, now I've really screwed it up. Locking my keys in the car has proved how I'm not a responsible adult at all. How could I even know that I'm gay, right?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:45:44.80">So Andy's in a snowy parking lot, alone. Finally, his mom drives up in the family's other car, gets out, and if this were a much shorter story, she would have simply given him the spare set of keys and driven home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:45:56.79">But instead, she unlocks the car and then gets in the other-- the passenger side and sits in the car with me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:46:01.69">And closes the door.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:46:02.51">Closes the door.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:46:03.68">And you're like, what are you doing?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:46:04.97">Well, I'm thinking, oh no. Now we're going to have the talk that I fled.</p><p begin="00:46:10.46">[NERVOUS MUMBLING] She looked not happy. You know, I was ready for that whole thing. I can't believe what you just did to our family, something like that.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:46:21.10">And what did she say?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:46:22.59">She said, about what you said earlier, I think I'm gay, too.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:46:31.86">What?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:46:32.59">Yeah. I was really surprised.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:46:40.60">I'm-- I don't know--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:46:41.99">Really, the emotion I felt was, I am completely off the hook now. Oh, I thought, this-- oh, my god. This is way bigger than my story. No one's going to care about me. Like once I really understood what she was saying--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:46:59.88">You're like, I have nothing to worry about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:47:01.15">I have nothing to worry about.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:47:02.46">That was the first thing he thought. The next thing was more like, what the hell's going on here? After all, Andy was a 19-year-old college sophomore at this point. He still thought that once you reached middle age, you didn't change anymore. Like his parents were these two paintings hanging in the house-- paintings that cooked him dinner when he came home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:47:20.67">I hadn't considered, like, you could actually propose a completely new life, and that you'd been thinking about it all along. All along? My whole life? She'd been waiting for this?</p><p begin="00:47:39.55">Oh, I did forget to say, after she said, "I think I'm gay, too," long pause. And then she says, "don't tell your father."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:47:49.40">So you have to keep this secret from your dad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:47:51.81">Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:47:53.20">Which is the hugest secret.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:47:55.17">I was just-- couldn't bear it. It was such a huge secret.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:47:59.59">I'm trying to think of a bigger secret you could keep from your dad.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:48:02.54">Murder.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:48:03.55">You murdered somebody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:48:04.51">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:48:05.02">Or your mom murdered somebody.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:48:05.68">My mom murdered somebody.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:48:07.01">Your mom murdered somebody. That would be bigger.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:48:08.91">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:48:11.06">Or your mom is Spider-Man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:48:13.83">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:48:14.36">That would be bigger.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:48:15.18">But it-- that's kind of how it felt, like my mom was Spider-Man in some way because to me, it was also exciting that I knew her secret identity. The things were all together in my head.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:48:26.00">Well, it was not Thanksgiving. It was January of 1990.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:48:30.90">This, of course, is Andy's mom, Sandra Greer. She remembers the story a little differently than Andy in places-- not only that it wasn't on Thanksgiving, but also that she and Andy's dad started wondering if Andy might be gay when he was four years old. Hence the <i>Growing</i> <i>Up</i> <i>Straight</i> book. So it wasn't much of a shock.</p><p begin="00:48:48.16">And one other thing you should know about Sandra before we continue is that she's an experimental chemist. Not just by profession, that's how she thinks about everything. For instance, she told me that when Andy announced he was gay, she had already started this long, slow process of coming out herself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:49:03.80">And it is true that his coming out probably catalyzed my coming out. It would have happened, but it would have taken maybe a little longer. I choose the word "catalyzed" carefully because catalyst changes the rate of things but does not change the final state of equilibrium. And so when I say his coming out was a catalyst, I mean exactly that.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:49:28.64">You see what I have to live with?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:49:34.27">Believe it or not, Andy and his mom actually haven't talked about any of this in the quarter century since it happened. And one of Andy's burning questions has been about Sandra's state of mind in between his big reveal in the kitchen and the moment she hopped in the car with him. Like, what was going on in her head? He figured-- in fact, he told her when we were all talking about it-- he says, you must have been in some emotional turmoil during that hour or so. But again, Sandra's a pragmatist and very much a mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:50:03.10">I was thinking that I needed to find a way to say this. And that this was about the only time that he and I would be alone. And that is coming out to me, not only did it give me permission to say this, but that it might be helpful to him to know that I knew what he was going through. And for him to give me some support.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:50:24.97">But were you nervous?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:50:27.45">Yes, I was. Yes, I was. I mean, this was a pretty big deal. So I was nervous and, at the same time, a little relieved that I could talk to him about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:50:42.13">And as they were sitting there in the car, Andy quickly realized, wait a second. This means we aren't going to be a family anymore, not in the same way, which wasn't a relief and wasn't exciting. Plus, it's just that he figured he was the gay one in the family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:50:59.12">Yeah, and then mom's like, takes over the show.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:51:02.86">Oh, so you felt like she was kind of stealing your thunder a little bit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:51:06.09">Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And after that, she did a little because she would start to tell relatives that I was gay.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:51:14.97">And this is where the story becomes not a story about the secretly gay mother of an openly gay son, but the ingeniously clever secretly gay mother of an openly gay son. The way Andy tells it, his mom basically took to the phones like a pollster in a boiler room, spreading the word that someone they knew very well had come out of the closet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:51:33.62">Well, because, of course, she was trying to figure out how people would react-- her mother would react-- to someone being gay at all, kind of test the waters for herself. But, you know, my mom was telling all kinds of people-- my great great aunt and Aunt Dot and all these people I didn't really even know.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:51:51.62">Wait. And you're like, what? Mom? Like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:51:53.71">Yeah it was spiraling out of control. Yeah, the Coopersteins knew. Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:51:58.50">Who are the Coopersteins?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:51:59.29">They were our next-door neighbors as a kid. Because I didn't think about those people except at, like, holidays. So when I went back to school, I didn't think, well, I'd better call the Coopersteins now because they were-- it's out of my mind. And then a week later, I hear that the Coopersteins-- Myrna Cooperstein has something to say about it.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:52:20.86">And were you, like,-- were you mad?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:52:25.80">No. She needed my story more than I did because she needed to test these people out. And it was the perfect way to do it before she dropped her own bomb probably a year or so later.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:52:42.39">Actually it wasn't a year or so later, says Andy's mom Sandra. She remembers this part differently, too. She says she told Andy's twin brother Mike just a couple of days later, and told their father only a couple of months after that, and then moved out in the spring. Also, she says she doesn't remember calling around to anybody about Andy except for her mother and her sister. And, yes, she probably told Myrna Cooperstein. But her coming out and Andy's coming out, they aren't as connected as that, she told me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:53:09.57">I guess the way that I think they may be connected-- so you're a chemist. And, in a way, it seems like telling folks around you that Andy is gay, it's like the perfect litmus test in a way.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:53:26.26">Ah, very good. Well done.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:53:28.67">Thank you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:53:30.81">I don't know that I consciously thought of it that way. But it certainly gave me more information. It gave me more information for my process, which was going to come later.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:53:42.25">So what information did it--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:53:44.13">The sky did not fall down. Life went on as we know it. Nobody disowned anybody. You know, nothing really bad happened.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:54:00.77">You've got to wonder what it must've been like for Sandra. She was 45. She says she hadn't so much as kissed a woman yet. And here comes her 19-year-old son, just boldly saying the very thing she's been hiding about herself -- like he was speaking her secret out loud. Did she feel some kind of twinge in her gut or some chill or something?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:54:20.53">I would say that he was more a role model for me.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:54:22.96">Oh, Mom.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:54:23.70">That he could show me how you could do this and live your life with integrity. He just flat out came out. And there was no hedging about it. And he didn't screw around about it. And the result was that people who loved you still loved you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:54:41.49">Oh, that's completely different way of seeing it. Wow.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Sandra Greer</h4><p begin="00:54:45.28">Yeah, I think that's the way I felt about it. That he was showing me how to do things.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:54:50.05">The funny thing is that Andy, for all his role modeling-ness, again, he was still a kid. And he still had a thing or two to learn from his mom about being open-minded.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:54:59.06">I had gone into the situation and basically said, I'm not who you think I am. I'm my own person. And you're going to have to deal with it. And then my mom said, I'm not who you think I am. I'm going to be my own person. I was like, no, no, no. But you have-- you're the mom. Not fair.</p><p begin="00:55:14.67">And then you also have to think about your parent as a human being. I know I was not ready. I was not open-minded enough to consider some golden rule about how you're supposed to act at coming-out stories.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:55:25.47">Do unto others.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andrew Sean Greer</h4><p begin="00:55:26.36">Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sean Cole</h4><p begin="00:55:27.01">But he got over it. And within a year or so, Sandra was living as a fully out gay person. And, of course, we all have these catalytic people in our lives. Usually it's an older sibling or a friend, the first person we knew who got us listening to cool music for a change, or kissed somebody, or left home and moved to a new city. Or it's your parents you're fashioning yourself after somehow. How often is it that a person you created and raised is the one who leads you over a threshold?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:02.64">Sean Cole is one of the producers of our program.
