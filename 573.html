This is what happens every time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:00:17.17">I'm just gonna post it and we'll see--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:00:18.47">We'll see what happens.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:00:19.17">--how quickly everything comes in.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:20.66">So what's your prediction on what's going to happen?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:00:22.11">Usually there's at least-- usually there's two likes in a minute. But I don't know, because people might not be up yet.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:00:28.23">People aren't-- there's--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:29.08">It was 11:00 in the morning on a day with no school, not prime time for posting photos at all. Nighttime is usually when you get the most likes and comments. But, you know, 11:00 AM. A minute passes. No response on the photo they took in the studio. And then?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:00:43.70">Oh, wait, three likes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:00:44.82">Oh, three likes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:00:46.16">From Ro--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:00:46.91">From three people. No one's commented yet. One of these is my best friend. OK, another person liked it. Two people.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:00:53.43">Two people. OK, we're getting a lot of likes now.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:00:54.51">Three. Another person.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:00:55.10">How many likes do we have now?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:00:56.55">Six, I think.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:00:57.56">OK, we have one, two, three, four, five, six likes in a minute. That's actually good, Ella.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:01.95">What they're waiting for is not just likes and comments but a specific kind of comment. This is probably not going to be news to any of you who have teenage girls in your lives, but I bet lots of you do not know about this. They want comments from other girls, and they say the wording is pretty much always the same.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:01:17.30">Gorgeous. Pretty. Stunning.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:01:19.73">Stunning? Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:01:20.76">You kill it. You're so pretty. So beautiful.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:23.82">OK, just to be clear, they say this about everybody's selfies, whether or not the selfies are, in fact, stunning or beautiful. This is super-affirming language that is applied equally to every girl, universally. You've heard of bullying online? This is the opposite.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:01:37.17">A lot of people don't just say pretty. You either say like, Pretty, WTF? Gorgeous, WTF? Perfect.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:01:42.85">Like all caps sometimes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:01:43.97">Um, some people say, like, model. You can add OMG after anything.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:01:48.10">Cutest, like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:01:49.10">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:01:49.51">Something "-est."</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:50.46">The one word you don't say? "Sexy." They explained you could say "hot," but never "sexy."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:01:55.99">They are-- there's a different--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:01:57.33">They're the same thing, actually.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:01:58.18">There's a different connotation to "sexy" than there is to "hot."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:02:00.40">'Cause, like, it has the word "sex" in it. Sex.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:02:02.38">Yeah, I think it's the word.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:02:03.65">Like, intercourse.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:02:04.24">Ella!</p><p begin="00:02:04.64">[GIRLS GIGGLE]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:05.44">This is not about sex. It's not about boys. It's about girls, and friendship. And it's very repetitive-- the same phrases, over and over. I asked them each to pick a selfie that they'd posted and read the comments.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:02:17.78">So I have gorgeous, pretty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:02:19.92">You're so pretty, OMG.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:02:21.05">So pretty.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:02:21.45">This is so pretty, OMG.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:02:22.63">Heart eyes. So pretty. Heart eyes. Gorgeous. Gorge.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:02:23.98">You're so pretty, bye.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:02:24.92">Cutest.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:25.81">They say their parents don't understand this. Ella's mom has Instagram, so she sees the pictures and the comments.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:02:30.69">She's just like, why? Why? Why is everyone doing this? Like, why are 50 people feeling the need to tell you that you're pretty?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:37.83">Julia's mom? Same thing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:02:39.31">She's like, why? Why are all these people saying, like, oh, you're so perfect? And my dad just thinks it's funny. He's like, why are these people doing this? Like, it doesn't-- it's kind of stupid. They think it's, like, stupid.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:50.17">So what's it about? Well, the answer to that question is complicated, and it involves going deep into an intricate language that's going on in the comments. Welcome to WBEZ Chicago. It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life.</i> I'm Ira Glass.</p><p begin="00:03:01.58">Today's program is about status updates of various kinds-- the literal kind, like on Instagram. But most of our show today is about the kind of slow changes in status that happen to adults, that happen usually when people get money or they get recognition, where what happens is, you know, quiet, and slow, and really, is sometimes kind of rude to talk about. Like, when do you say to anybody, "Hey, you're making a lot more money than you used to." Or, "Hey, you're making a lot less money." Or, "You're making a lot more money than me."</p><p begin="00:03:29.58">And that's why I wanted to talk to Jane and Ella and Julia. Because for them, this stuff is not gradual or vague or shameful to talk about. It's happening out in the open, online. They're online all the time, constantly getting updates on the social standing of everybody they know, in detail and at incredible speed. And that's what these Instagram comments are all about, if you know how to read them.</p></div>  </div>
</div><div class="act" id="act1">
  <h3>Act One. Finding the Self in Selfie.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:04:35.17">It's definitely a social obligation, because you want to let them know, and also let people who are seeing those, that I have a close relationship with this person, so close that I can comment on their pictures, like, this is so cute, or, you look so great here.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:47.42">Then, of course, when you do post a comment about a picture, there's the whole politics of whether your friend is going to comment back to your comment. And subtle differences in the wording when they comment back could mean something, even though, to an outsider, the words basically look the same. Julia says that she'll comment back, oh my god, I love you so much, to a close friend who compliments a picture of hers. But she says with somebody you don't know so well, it goes differently.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:05:11.83">If they say, like, oh my god, like, you're so pretty, you say, OMG, but that's you. You know, like-- like you're the pretty one? I feel like that's something that I say to someone who's like-- who I'm not super close with, but I feel like-- like I have to say something back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:05:27.54">Especially because we, like, just started high school, so we're meeting a lot of new people. So you would comment on someone's photo who you're not really super close with or that you don't know really well. And it's sort of a statement, like, I want to be friends with you, or I want to get to know you, or like, I think you're cool.</p><p begin="00:05:40.31">If someone that you don't know very well commented on your photo, you-- it's sort of like an unspoken agreement that you have to comment back on their photo. Like when you're making new friends, if they comment on your photo, you comment on their photo.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:05:51.29">It's like a chain reaction.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:05:52.56">Another thing you don't see if you don't know this language of comments and commenting back-- let's say that you comment on somebody's photo. When they comment back, do they comment to you individually? Or do they group you in with 20 or 30 other people and send just one big group comment back to all of you? That tells you where you stand with the person.</p><p begin="00:06:10.65">Then there are all those situations where somebody choosing not to comment is a really big deal. Like for example, if you post a picture of yourself with a friend and then the friend does not comment on that picture, that's just cold. That is leaving you dangling. Or if you post a selfie, close friends are expected to chime in with support. When they don't?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:06:29.99">You definitely feel insecure. Because, like, you expect them to comment, and they don't, and you're like, why?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:06:35.75">This isn't even good enough for, like, my best friend.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:06:38.22">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:06:38.48">Then you're like, oh, wait.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:06:39.98">Like, what if they've seen it  and they're just not liking it on purpose, or like, what if everybody who's seeing it thinks that we're not actually friends because they're not commenting on it. They haven't commented yet. It's been X amount of time and they still haven't liked it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:06:51.53">It's this kind of shallow-- like, why are you not responding to something that I never said you had to respond to in the first place?</p><p begin="00:06:58.33">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:59.31">And tell me about how quickly people have to respond. Like, what's the normal amount of time?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:07:03.40">Within 10 minutes, I think.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:07:05.07">Yeah, usually.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:07:05.24">People are always on Instagram. Everyone's always on Instagram.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:07:07.56">There's definitely a weird psychology to it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:07:09.32">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:07:10.14">Definitely.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:07:10.99">It's just sort of the way it is. It's like unspoken rules that everybody knows and follows.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:14.45">But can I ask you, have you gotten caught up in weird mind games where somebody commented or liked or didn't comment or didn't like, and then you're just like, I don't-- what does this-- what does this one means?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:07:23.37">Yeah. Someone like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:07:24.57">Ella has an example. I mean, these girls that went to our middle school, they--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:07:28.40">Yeah, this is not my picture, but someone said, what even? You're perfect. I hate you. Eff you. You suck. And then like someone else, like-- WTF? You're perfect. I hate you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:07:39.10">Because people-- what they're trying to say is, like, you're still perfect and you're so beautiful that I, like, hate you for it, and I wish I was like you so much that I dislike you for it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:07:48.20">And how do you respond to that? Like, I'm sorry?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:07:50.70">Because you don't say, like-- you don't say, like, thank you, because it's not really a compliment. You don't really know.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:07:54.99">We've all gotten those comments of-- last year, like, this girl even said it to my face. She was like, you're so pretty, like, I'm going to throw you into the train tracks. Like things that-- like it doesn't even make sense. Like it's--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:08:06.29">Like on my photo right now-- I'm looking at it-- this girl commented, I hate you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:08:10.06">Um, I've also, like, been, like, caught in the situation where someone's like, you're so pretty, and I'm like, oh, thank you. You're really pretty too. And then we've gotten into this whole thing, and I remember, like magical mirrors came up, like potions.</p><p begin="00:08:23.61">And I was just like, wait, this is way too deep. Like, you must be looking in a mirror then, because you must be talking to yourself, because you're so pretty. She was like, we should switch bodies with, like, a potion. I was like, what?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:43.25">Ella and Julia and Jane say that usually, they'll get 130 to 150 likes for any selfie they put up, and anywhere between 30 and 50 comments, which is a good response. And overwhelmingly, these comments are these super-positive, you're so pretty, OMG, you're so cute kind. And a lot of it is heartfelt, girls just trying to be good friends to each other. When you see your friend put herself out there, it's nice to tell her she's pretty.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:07.11">Can I ask, like, does it work? Because you know, when you're getting over 100 likes and comments and things like that, like, you know, a lot of it is just rote, right? A lot of people are just like, they see a thing, and they just automatically--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:09:19.57">Yeah, you're scrolling through.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:09:20.83">It's mindless.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:09:22.07">That's how--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:22.49">It's mindless. And so since it's mindless, does it still work? Does it make you feel good?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:09:27.63">Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:09:28.89">Um, actually, if I get a comment from someone I care about, I think it makes me feel good, like it lifts me up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:09:37.19">A lot of it is just scrolling, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:09:38.44">But a lot of it's just, like, I literally just scroll through my Instagram feed and I just, like, click, like double-tap.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:09:43.76">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:09:43.98">And like, it doesn't--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:09:44.69">I like everything on my feed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:09:45.68">You know, like it just doesn't-- and that's what people are doing to your photo. But, like, it still makes you feel good, because you're getting all these likes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:52.35">Yeah, but when you think about it, it's so strange. Because you know how superficial it is.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:09:55.72">It is.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:56.19">And yet--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:09:56.65">You know, but yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:09:57.71">Yeah.  You know that you're doing it to other people, but--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:09:59.61">And yet it's still--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:10:00.07">Then other people are doing it to you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:01.22">And it still feels like something, though.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:10:03.01">Like, it does make you feel good. You're like, oh, I'm getting all these comments. Like, people like my photo. They think I'm pretty. Like, they're saying that you're pretty. And if someone comes up to you and says you're pretty, like, you're obviously going to be like, thank you, if it makes you feel good. Because it just does. Like, that's like human nature. Like, you're going to feel good.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:19.77">This is really not so different from anybody's life on social media. When I tweet something and a friend favorites it, and another friend retweets with a funny comment, that is totally them saying to me, you're so pretty-- just in a more adult kind of way. And it feels nice.</p><p begin="00:10:35.06">All three of these girls told me they don't need 50 people telling them that they're pretty all the time. But you know, it's there for the taking. It's like free candy. Why not?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:44.14">Do you feel like this is a situation where, like, girls are so judged all the time on how they look, and this is a way to counteract that, by you guys saying to each other, like, you're pretty, you're pretty?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:10:54.18">Well, no. It just gives more opportunities for people to judge. They're not going to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:10:58.01">Yeah, posting a photo of yourself is putting yourself out there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:10:59.29">They're not going to do it on social media, obviously, because you will see it. But they'll do it behind your back.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:05.12">When a girl posts an unflattering selfie, or just a selfie that makes her look uncool, other girls will take screenshots to save the image and gossip about it later. Happens all the time. And so even though they're old hands at posting selfies-- they've been posting since sixth grade-- it can be nervous-making to post one. So they take precautions.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:11:24.00">We all ask people before we post it, like send in like a group chat, or like, send to your friends, like, should I post this? Do I look pretty? And they say, like, all the same stuff that they would say in a comment. Like, oh my god, yes, post it. Like, you're so pretty. You're so perfect. So like--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:38.67">And so it'd be like you run it by like four or five friends.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:11:40.50">Yeah. If I send it to my friends, I'm not nervous about it, because then I have--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:11:44.15">OK.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:44.60">Jane looks at her phone. There's a message.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:11:47.11">Like someone just texted in a giant group chat, go like my photo on Instagram. It just shows that it happens every--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:11:52.32">It happens every second.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:11:53.51">It happens all the time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:11:54.30">Yep. I got it, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:11:55.52">Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:56.23">I have to say, like, oh my god, this is such a job.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Girls</h4><p begin="00:11:59.02">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:11:59.86">It's like I'm-- I'm a brand, and I am like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:12:04.02">You're trying to promote yourself.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:12:05.06">The brand.

In middle school, we were definitely really relevant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ella</h4><p begin="00:12:20.28">(SARCASTICALLY)  We were so relevant.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:12:20.47">Because everything was established. But now, in the beginning of high school, you can't really tell who's relevant.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:12:26.48">Yeah. And what does relevant mean?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:12:29.81">Relevant means that people care about what you're posting on Instagram. People--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Julia</h4><p begin="00:12:32.96">Care about you.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jane</h4><p begin="00:12:33.23">--want to know what you're doing.

  <h3>Act Two. Mon Ami Ta-Nehisi.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:14:45.28">Act 2. Mon Ami Ta-Nehisi. Well, our show today is about status updates. And you know, it's weird when a sudden change of status happens to somebody who you're close with. And that's true whether their status goes up or their status goes down.</p><p begin="00:14:58.90">One of our producers, Neil Drumming, is best friends with the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who I think a lot of people heard of for the first time a couple years ago when he wrote this article arguing the case for reparations for black Americans. That article was nothing compared to the attention that Ta-Nehisi got when his latest book was published this summer. The book has been on the <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Times</i> Bestseller List ever since. He's been interviewed all over the place. He's been called the next James Baldwin. Ta-Nehisi Coates was suddenly famous and rich, and Neil, our co-worker, definitely was not. He does fine, but, you know. Anyway, it got Neil thinking.</p><p begin="00:15:34.70">Quick warning-- there's some cursing in this story that we bleeped on the radio version of our show. Here on the podcast and the internet, we are unbleeping it. If you're somebody who prefers the bleeped version-- maybe you listen to the show with kids-- you can find it at our website.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:15:47.88">One of the weird things about having a famous friend is that even when he's too busy to hang out, he's sort of around all the time. I hadn't seen Ta-Nehisi in a few months. But in the last year or two, it seemed like everyone was reading his work and talking about it-- everyone on the subway, the President of the United States, my ex who texted me out of the blue to see if I could get her into one of his speaking engagements-- everyone.</p><p begin="00:16:09.19">But by July, I was cat-sitting just 15 blocks from Ta-Nehisi's apartment and he and I still hadn't connected. We tried, but it just didn't work out. I was walking past a newsstand on Broadway, thinking I should try texting him again, that I had so much to tell him. And when I looked up, he was right in front of me, his big-ass disembodied head staring at me from the cover of <i>New</i> <i>York</i> <i>Magazine</i>.</p><p begin="00:16:31.20">By the end of the summer, Ta-Nehisi had turned 40 and moved his family to Paris. He won the MacArthur Genius Award. He was across the ocean, and coworkers were congratulating me for him. It's wild having the world talk so much about someone you know and with whom you share so much history. It's exciting and, oddly, kind of gratifying. I'm happy for him.</p><p begin="00:16:52.73">The thing I'm having trouble with is harder to explain. I know Ta-Nehisi's the same guy-- warm, funny, curious, loves comic books. But he's also a famous writer who lives in Paris, accepts prestigious awards in a tuxedo that he owns, and gets shout-outs from Toni Morrison and Jay Z. He's changing in ways that I'm not. And when people change, they grow apart. And it makes me worry about our friendship.</p><p begin="00:17:17.44">Like when we're making plans. A couple of months ago, Ta-Nehisi, our other buddy, Rick, and I were supposed to meet for Sunday brunch at our old West Side haunt, The Half King. The Half King is a pub, not a dive, a respectable pub with good service, good beer, and decent food. The morning of the scheduled meeting, he texted to ask if we can meet at the swanky Hotel Marlton instead. His explanation? "I'm becoming that dude."</p><p begin="00:17:42.61">Rick was understanding. He joked that since eating in Paris, everything back home must taste like dog food. Ta-Nehisi's response? "It's close."</p><p begin="00:17:52.05">Sometimes he ends emails with unnecessary French interpolations of everyday phrases. In this country, we have a word for such behavior, and it's the same word in Ta-Nehisi's newly adopted language.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:18:02.13">Je suis snob.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:18:02.95">That's how you say, "I'm a snob" in French?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:18:04.36">Je suis snob. Snob. I gotta get my accent right. Je suis snob.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:18:08.64">I tease him about becoming a snob, but we've never really talked about it. And so, cautiously and nervously, a couple weeks ago, I asked him if we could. We texted back and forth to set a time when we could sit down. At one point, he suggested that I go through his assistant.</p><p begin="00:18:24.79">Ta-Nehisi was tired from a long day of meetings and signing books, so he and I ended up at the bar of the hotel where he was staying. It's a lavish joint with a rooftop pool deck and big, cushioned banquettes in the lounge. We sat up on the mezzanine, overlooking the low-lit bar.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:18:38.55">Is this the best hotel you ever stayed in?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:18:40.15">No.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:18:40.54">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:18:41.13">This ain't that good of a hotel. But it's perfectly decent. I got a nice room here.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:18:45.19">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:18:46.09">How's this feel to you? Does this feel like a nice hotel to you?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:18:49.32">Ta-Nehisi knew we were here to talk about his snobbery, and he wasted zero time getting into character. He told me a story about the other night when he'd had dinner in the restaurant of this very hotel.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:18:58.39">And I was sitting at the bar. And the food was OK. It's like one of these OK food restaurants. But it was decent. I  was having a good time. And there was a couple like down the bar, and they had ordered this big-ass thing of oysters. It might have been 24 oysters. It was huge.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:19:11.47">Ta-Nehisi was fine with that. He loves oysters. It was what happened next that offended him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:19:16.67">Then the bartender started making drinks, right? And he makes the woman a sangria and the other dude some sweet something, some red, sweet something-or-other that no one should ever drink. And he took it over there, and I was like, you're going to drink sangria and eat oysters? Like, we're doing this now? Like, this is a thing you're going to do? Oh, come on.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:19:43.49">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:19:44.72">Come on. Just order a Hi-C. Get the Capri Sun. Just get the Capri Sun with your oysters.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:19:51.87">See, this is what I'm talking about.</p><p begin="00:19:54.15"/><p begin="00:20:01.48">I met Ta-Nehisi in the late '90s when we were both working at an alternative weekly newspaper in DC. He was still a student at Howard. I had recently graduated from college.</p><p begin="00:20:12.39">I'm pretty sure neither of us had ever even tasted an oyster back then. Instead, we bonded over hip hop, two-for-one happy hours, the enduring craziness of white people, and wanting to be better writers than the ones in our favorite rap magazine. We bopped around U Street drinking rail liquor and debating the merits of Ghostface, Buckshot, and Brother J.</p><p begin="00:20:33.48">We did growing-up stuff, too. We paid rent. We met girls. I remember the day Ta-Nehisi came by the cubicle where I worked to tell me his girlfriend was pregnant. I thought, at 24, his life is over. But soon, I'd have a godson.</p><p begin="00:20:48.92">We also got pretty serious about writing. Eventually, we both ended up in New York. We got jobs. We got married. Our wives became best friends, as well. We stayed close.</p><p begin="00:21:00.69">During all those years, I honestly don't recall fine dining being a big part of our lives, so it's kind of bizarre to hear Ta-Nehisi go on about it now. The guy talks about food with almost as much passion and conviction as he writes scathing critiques of American institutionalized racism.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:21:14.76">There's this joint in Chicago called the Girl &amp;amp; the Goat, and they made this asparagus last time I was there, and I think about it. Like I actually think about the vegetables.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:21:23.10">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:21:24.09">I mean, what is this?

That was great.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:21:35.06">I can't imagine feeling so strongly about vegetables. But we're laughing and drinking adult beverages. This is fun and kind of familiar.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:21:43.59">You know what this makes me think of?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:21:45.39">What?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:21:46.29">The New Year's Eve parties at the place you used to live in--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:21:49.77">Yeah, yeah, yeah, in Brooklyn.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:21:50.70">In Brooklyn, yeah.

So for instance, I don't want to put my son in some exclusive club or something, literally like some sort of societal something or other. Do you know what I mean?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:25:53.23">So bougie is a status thing.

All right, all right.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:25:59.10">Yeah, I don't go to a nice gym so that I can then tell you I go to a nice gym.

'Cause it's--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:26:26.69">Maybe Ta-Nehisi doesn't care about being with the right people. I've seen him blow off invitations to hang out with TV stars and dodge the attention of world-famous rappers. But he does move in elite circles these days, hanging out with Michael Chabon, collaborating with David Simon, lunches with David Remnick. For the record, that's a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, the creator of <i>The</i> <i>Wire</i>, and the editor of <i>The</i> <i>New</i> <i>Yorker</i>.</p><p begin="00:26:50.48">Me, I work at home.

But it hadn't occurred to me that he would think I was the one who had changed, that that might be the reason for the distance between us. And after the divorce, Ta-Nehisi did keep reaching out. He'd call to talk about writing, or to get feedback on what he was working on, which was always kind of confusing to me.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:28:45.22">I have to admit, I'm kind of like, well, you could also call David Simon, or any of these people who you have on speed dial--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:28:50.90">Yeah, but my friends haven't really changed, you know that?

I think it was wanting to feel like we're still on the same level, which has not-- it's not an intellectual thing as much as it is, like-- it is an intellectual thing because our friendship is intellectual.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:29:54.17">Right, right, right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:29:55.01">That friendship is heartfelt and true, but also, like, the way we come up is ideas.

But this is some shit I thought of, and it really hit me this weekend, or last weekend. Because I realized that I was doing a lot of intellectual gymnastics in my head about how I felt about us, and I realized I've seen you a bunch of times since then, and you're going through something, and I'm not asking you if you're OK. And I haven't asked you, like, if you're--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:30:54.69">No, I'm not OK. [LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:30:56.50">And that's the thing that hit me, literally, like this weekend. I was like, wait a minute.

"Ta-Nehisi Coates, November 3, Miller Auditorium." Holy shit.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:31:37.22">She must want to know, is she seeing that?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:31:39.75">OK, so what's the good in that? What's the good in that and what's the bad in that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:31:43.33">I mean, the good in that is that, um-- the message is going to a lot of people. Like, what you write is clearly, on some level, being received by a lot of people. The bad in that is my face.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:32:00.90">Ta-Nehisi doesn't like having his face on a billboard. He doesn't like being recognized in the street. I know the guy. I don't have many people in my life I know as well as him. He's never wanted to be famous or celebrated. In that way, he's right. He hasn't changed.</p><p begin="00:32:18.50">He and I talked for two more hours, and it felt like it always has. But we've lost a lot of the other stuff, the stuff that makes most friendships work. We don't go to the same parties or eat in the same restaurants. We don't share as many friends. He's raising a kid, and I just quit Tinder. We don't even live in the same country. Without all of that, what we have left feels more delicate.</p><p begin="00:32:44.19">So now I have another worry. I worry that the conversation that I just forced us to have, where I made such a big deal out of our differences, has in some way screwed with that friendship even more.</p><p begin="00:33:03.67">I went to see Ta-Nehisi speak at the Schomburg Center in Harlem. It was the first time I'd been to one of his public appearances in a very long time. The line outside was around the corner. When the audience was let in, they spilled over into a different room. 9,000 people had RSVP'd for 350 seats. Ta-Nehisi was engaging and provocative on stage. I felt proud. He was nice on the mic, and the crowd loved him.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:33:29.38">It's very, very important to me that I remember to go back to that and not enroll myself in my own judgment.</p><p begin="00:33:35.30">[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]</p><p begin="00:33:37.12">I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:33:40.00">Afterwards, I waited outside the green room with Ta-Nehisi's wife and a handful of his friends, some from his Howard days. Celebrities like Common and Usher were there as well, pressing to get backstage to meet him. I chatted with his son, Samori, my godson, about how he was liking Paris. He was having girl trouble. Like his dad used to, I joked.</p><p begin="00:34:01.10">We had dinner reservations at Red Rooster in Harlem, but it was live jazz night and they wanted us to pay to be quiet. Ta-Nehisi wasn't having it. Later he'd say the joint was bougie. So we went down the street to Sylvia's and had a great time.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:34:15.78">We gotta go, babe.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Kenyatta Matthews</h4><p begin="00:34:16.77">Bye, guys.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:34:17.76">All right, talk to you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:34:18.87">I'm not gonna see you for--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:34:19.47">Hey, man, thanks for hanging, man.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:34:20.05">Of course, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:34:20.96">You had a good time?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Neil Drumming</h4><p begin="00:34:21.45">Yeah, of course, man.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4><p begin="00:34:22.43">OK.

  <h3>Act Three.  There Owes the Neighborhood.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:35:14.20">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on the program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program-- "Status Update."</p><p begin="00:35:21.15">Today's program is about people whose position in the world changes, in one way or another, and how they deal with it. So far on our show, we've had a literal status update, the social media kind. We've heard what it sounds like inside a friendship where there's been a major shift in status.</p><p begin="00:35:35.14">And now we've arrived at Act Three of our show. Act Three, There Owes the Neighborhood. In this act, we're going to look at an entire city getting a status update. And the man who gave this city the news about itself was named Paul Kiel. Before the city knew, Paul Kiel knew. And before Paul Kiel knew, nobody knew.</p><p begin="00:35:52.09">Here's what happened. Paul's an investigative reporter with ProPublica. And he discovered that over the last 15 years, this new kind of debt collector has become more prevalent. These are companies that go after people who owe on their credit cards, or car loans, or hospital bills, or whatever.</p><p begin="00:36:06.30">And these companies, what they do is they garnish people's wages. They garnish their wages. They take the money right out of their paychecks. Sometimes they go straight into their bank accounts and take the money.</p><p begin="00:36:16.47">They got this power by taking these people to court. Way more consumers who owe money are being taken to court. These companies sue those consumers, which used to be rare. They sue, and they win. And because they win, they get the power to garnish these wages.</p><p begin="00:36:33.33">OK, so figuring out that part was just the beginning. Chana Joffe-Walt talked to Paul Kiel.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:36:38.80">It was a struggle to get numbers on wage garnishing. How many people? How much money? Where were those people? Paul Kiel loves this kind of thing. He's an even-measured guy who enjoys the grunt work of tracking down which file cabinet in which municipal building of which small town has the information he needs.</p><p begin="00:36:59.37">Eventually, Paul and his colleague Annie Waldman had managed to track down the names and addresses of every single person who'd been sued for not paying their debts in three cities-- Newark, Chicago, and St. Louis. They put all that information into the computer, and then Paul looked at what they had.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:37:17.26">Without doing a fancy analysis, if we sorted our neighborhoods so that the ones that had the most lawsuits were at the top, it was all black neighborhoods.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:37:27.34">In Newark, Chicago--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:37:28.11">In Newark and Chicago and in St. Louis.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:37:31.14">All of them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:37:31.73">All of them.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:37:32.97">So there were way more lawsuits in black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:37:36.58">Yes. That was clear no matter how you looked at it. In neighborhoods that had the same income level, the same household income, on average, we were finding twice as many lawsuits in the mostly black neighborhoods. And then it was a real question of why.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:37:58.64">Paul knew people would look at this and think what I thought. This is just discrimination-- companies targeting black people and black neighborhoods.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:38:08.88">Did you think this was just racism?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:38:11.62">No, I didn't. No, I didn't jump to that conclusion, just because I know how it's such a large and impersonal system. You know, debt-buying companies and other banks might never meet their customers. You're literally a name on a spreadsheet to these companies. So it was immediately like a puzzle that we needed to find an answer to.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:38:36.65">Paul's first clue to the answer came when he went to a place called Jennings, Missouri. Jennings is a suburb of St. Louis, home to an astonishing amount of wage garnishing. And Jennings is where Paul met Cori Winfield.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cori Winfield</h4><p begin="00:38:50.44">Oh my god. OK, so like an example.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:38:53.25">Cori was the first person to show Paul her paycheck. She works for a brokerage services firm in St. Louis.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cori Winfield</h4><p begin="00:38:59.92">I just got paid Friday. And my check is usually, gross, around $1,100, $1,200, something like that. But when I got my-- when I got paid Friday, I had $691 on my check. My rent is $750.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:39:19.85">Here's how this happened. Cori was married-- four kids and a neat brick bungalow under a shady tree with a patch of grass just large enough to be called a lawn. She had a mortgage on that brick bungalow, and she had a van she bought in 2009 for $8,000. The loan on that van is the one that got her in trouble. That's the loan Cori's now paying for out of her paycheck.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:39:42.26">So the lender in this case was Midwest Acceptance, which is like a St. Louis-based, mostly subprime auto loan company.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:39:51.39">Midwest Acceptance.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:39:52.32">Midwest Acceptance, yes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:39:54.40">Subprime meaning high interest rate. Really high-- 30%. In 2010, Cori stopped paying the car loan. And she stopped paying it for a bunch of reasons. Her husband left, so she had to carry the car loan and the mortgage on the brick bungalow with the small patch of grass all by herself.</p><p begin="00:40:13.58">Also, Cori's stepfather died. She got a new boyfriend. Her boyfriend was killed. She took a brief absence from work. One of her dogs died. She describes herself at this time as very distracted.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cori Winfield</h4><p begin="00:40:26.79">So I wasn't keeping up with court dates. I wasn't paying attention to the notices they were sending in the mail.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:40:33.09">And they were sending lots of notices. They were calling, too.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Cori Winfield</h4><p begin="00:40:36.79">Midwest Acceptance. And they'd be like, um, when are you going to be in to make a payment? I'll be in, um, on my next pay period.</p><p begin="00:40:45.46">Well, we need you to come in before then.  You're going to have to do something. You don't got a grandma you can call? You don't got a mama you can call? Or little stuff like that.</p><p begin="00:40:53.79"/></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:40:58.16">The grandma. This turned out to be Paul's answer. Cori did have a grandma she often called, but her grandma was already trying to help Cori save her house. And she was helping Cori with car rides once Midwest repo'd Cori's car.</p><p begin="00:41:13.49">Her grandma was also helping Cori's mom and her uncle. And she was doing all that on a pension. Cori's grandma was the only person she'd ever been able to call in this kind of situation.</p><p begin="00:41:31.38">If you ask people, could you borrow $3,000 from a friend or family member in an emergency? White people are much more likely to say yes. Poor whites, a white person living in abject poverty, has roughly the same ability to borrow $3,000 in an emergency as a middle-class black person. That's according to the largest national survey of consumer finance. If you compare Jennings, where Cori was, to white towns where people make the same amount of money?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:42:01.14">In that income bracket, whites, on average, have five times the wealth as black households.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:42:07.43">So wealth meaning home ownership and savings and investments and all of that stuff?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:42:12.83">It's like everything you have that you could turn into money, whether it be equity in your home, or your car, or whatever. It was right in front of me. So if people in the same income level have five times the wealth, it seems very credible that that would have a major impact on whether they're able to deal with a debt. That, to me, is-- the answer's right there.</p><p begin="00:42:30.27">And you were asking me, like, well, is this because of discrimination? And we don't have direct evidence that these suits are happening more often in black communities because of discrimination, but the racial wealth gap is definitely because of discrimination.</p><p begin="00:42:44.48">So why do we have a racial wealth gap? Because we had centuries of racist public policy. And even in the 20th century, blacks were prevented from buying homes in certain areas, and there were a lot of policies that helped whites build wealth at the same time they were preventing blacks from doing that. So it was-- it's a wealth gap that was fostered by racist policy, which we really haven't recovered from. Because wealth takes time to build over generations.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:43:15.33">Paul knew all of this before he started looking into wage garnishing. He knew this history, from Jim Crow laws all the way up through restrictive covenants in housing. He knew the data. But it wasn't until Cori that he considered it the answer to his puzzle.</p><p begin="00:43:31.35">Which is interesting. The wealth gap is such a basic old fact about America that it's become a saggy, meaningless phrase. "The widening wealth gap." "How to narrow the wealth gap."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:43:43.34">It's kind of an abstract concept.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:43:46.55">And this is what it looks like.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:43:47.86">Right. Yeah. And so this is one good illustration of that.</p><p begin="00:43:54.75">So I'm standing on a street. Standing on a street in the middle of Jennings, not too far from the high school.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:44:03.62">Paul found himself in a peculiar situation. He had a detailed spreadsheet, with addresses, listing everyone who hasn't paid their debts, how much they owed, and for what. Basically he had a map of the neighborhood he was standing in that included intimate details about people's financial lives.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:44:21.87">About half the homes on this block have had a lawsuit against them.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:44:28.04">On some blocks, it was every other house. Sometimes there were a few in just one house. It was a social map of the neighborhood that was the opposite of the carefully curated status updates you usually see.</p><p begin="00:44:40.19">What Paul could see was something real and messy-- what was going on with people's finances. And he wondered, if you live here, do you just know about this? Or do you actually need to see the map to picture it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:44:53.64">There's a street-- there's a house at the end here.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Woman</h4><p begin="00:44:56.24">How did you get my name?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:44:58.73">Well, it was court records.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Woman</h4><p begin="00:45:00.04">OK.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:45:00.85">So--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Woman</h4><p begin="00:45:01.35">They are public.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:45:02.59">They are public, yeah. And--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:45:04.06">This woman, Devorah, had been sued for money she owed the Metropolitan Sewer District. But she did not know that they'd sued her next door neighbor, too. Up the street and around the corner, Paul finds a block party going on. He sees a guy barbecuing in front of his house, and he knows this guy was sued, too. But the guy doesn't feel like talking about it.</p><p begin="00:45:25.03">The next few people did talk to Paul about it, and the disruption that led to them being sued-- a health incident, a family issue. For Latanya Graves, it was when she lost her job.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Latanya Graves</h4><p begin="00:45:35.38">At the time, I was just trying to get back on my feet. I was laid off from Western Union.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:45:40.65">And how they had no one to call who could help.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:45:43.21">Well, I would say, did you know that there was essentially one lawsuit for every four people? And they would say, no, I didn't know that.</p><p begin="00:45:51.34">All these suits on this block.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Latanya Graves</h4><p begin="00:45:53.64">Oh, on this block?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:45:54.85">On this street.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Latanya Graves</h4><p begin="00:45:55.65">Wow.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:45:57.75">This is a neighborhood where one in four people had been sued, and nobody knows that they're not the only one.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:46:05.58">Definitely nobody knew. [CHUCKLES] Nobody knew the numbers, and definitely, there was universal surprise at how prevalent it was.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:46:23.18">Paul stopped by a brick bungalow, Cori Winfield's house. Only it's not her house anymore, because Cori lost the house to foreclosure after the car loan. It is now Rosalyn Turner's house. Rosalyn also has had her wages garnished. She was working at Walmart, and suddenly a quarter of her paycheck started disappearing.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Rosalyn Turner</h4><p begin="00:46:44.76">Yes. After they started garnishing me, Walmart gave me a number to call. And I called them, and they wouldn't tell me much.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:46:51.99">And Paul learned something else.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:46:54.33">She had been sued by Midwest Acceptance, as well. It was the same company that Cori had been sued by.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:47:01.19">Who used to live in the same house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:47:02.62">Who used to live in the same house. So it was like, jeez.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:47:06.56">Rosalyn didn't know about Cori. Cori didn't know about Rosalyn. Paul was giving an entire neighborhood a status update on itself. Not that he'd set out to do that, but there he was, letting people know where they stood, relative to one another, even sometimes within the same family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:47:26.22">It happened twice where I was like, who is X? And they're like, oh, that's my daughter. I was like, do you remember them dealing with a lawsuit from so-and-so? No. I mean, I found that-- yeah, even in the same house, people don't know.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:47:42.82">Like here, in Dora Byrd's house. Paul asks, who's Camille Lee?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4> Dora Byrd</h4><p begin="00:47:48.36">That's my granddaughter. What's Camille Lee got to do with-- what's going on with that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:47:53.78">Uh, sorry.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:47:54.44">In this one family, Dora Byrd had been sued for debt, her daughter had been sued for debt-- now she was learning her granddaughter had been sued for debt. Dora Byrd would try to help her granddaughter, now that she knows, but it will be hard, because a third of Dora's savings was garnished, too.</p><p begin="00:48:18.67">On his last day in Jennings, Paul stopped by a brick house with three lawsuits.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:48:23.60">Yeah, so I went and knocked on the door, and a woman answered the second time we tried.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:48:30.41">Miranda Jones. She welcomed him in.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:48:33.02">We went around her backyard. Then I learned that she is a councilwoman. She's a council member in Jennings, which was a surprise.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:48:40.94">Although it made sense, given the fact that she seemed to be commanding various operations by cellphone on a Saturday.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miranda Jones</h4><p begin="00:48:47.36">It's on my desk. It's on my desk.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:48:50.33">Paul tells Councilwoman Jones about his data.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:48:52.95">She said, you know, you should talk to the mayor. And so she texted the mayor while I was talking to her.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:48:59.23">The mayor called right back.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Miranda Jones</h4><p begin="00:49:00.58">Hey, Yolanda. Hey. I got a question for you. So there's a reporter that knocked on my door. He's from the--</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:49:07.60">The mayor said she'd be happy to meet Paul in her office.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:49:10.25">And then I drove right over to City Hall.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:49:13.54">They sat down in the council chambers.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:49:15.72">I thought we were going to have like a kind of broader, 30,000-foot-- sort of the broader issues, like, what is this doing to my community as mayor? Like, that's the conversation that I thought we were going to have.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:49:27.13">And what happened?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:49:29.13">So we started that way, and then she just kind of casually threw in the conversation that "I've been sued by the sewerage district, too."</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:49:34.76">I'm going to be honest with you. I was one of the ones that was sued, as well, falling behind because I didn't have-- you know, I lost my job.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:49:41.75">And I tried not to-- I don't think I reacted in any way, because I try not to. But yeah, I was surprised, and I was-- it's almost like unbelievable at this point. And then at that point, I turned around and I wrote down the names that I saw, like on the name-- so we were in the city council chambers. It shows what all the names of all the city council members are. So I wrote all their names down and I was like, OK, when I get home, I'm going to look at the database and see how many city council members had actually been sued.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:50:14.05">How many?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:50:14.99">So it was five of the eight city council members had been sued over a debt. It's to the point where, yeah, it's unbelievable how common it is.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:50:28.29">This should not be unbelievable by this point, right? Because Paul knows the data, has walked the streets. He's stared at the map. But still, it feels unbelievable. To the mayor, too, the mayor who has detailed knowledge of this particular community, who has experienced this herself. When Paul showed her her own block on his laptop?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:50:50.03">Wow. See, that's my neighbor across the street. [INAUDIBLE] is right--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:50:57.65">You get a sense that literally like--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:50:59.53">Every other house.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Paul Kiel</h4><p begin="00:51:00.58">Yeah. It's funny--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:51:02.24">They're just suing all of us.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:51:04.90">"They're Just Suing All of Us." That was the front-page headline of the <i>St.</i> <i>Louis</i> <i>Post</i> <i>Dispatch</i>. Paul wrote a story for the paper about all this last month. So now, this thing that no one ever talks about, no one wants to talk about, that everyone is just keeping as their own private shame, was out. What happens then? How does this unusual and sudden sort of status update change things?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:51:32.38">It was kind of like-- it was sad, but then it was kind of like a relief. Because I'm like, oh my goodness, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:51:38.73">This is the mayor, Yolanda Henderson.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:51:40.93">To see that long list, it was just-- wow.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:51:46.31">But you haven't talked to people about it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:51:48.38">No. You know, it-- that's not like a common thing you just start talking about. Hey, my wages are getting garnished. How about yours?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:52:00.54">I heard this from a few people. Now that they know their neighbors are in the same situation, they still don't want to talk about it. It's embarrassing. Mayor Henderson had her mayor's wages garnished just six months after she was elected. A very awkward finance person had the unlucky job of telling the new mayor that she'd be seeing a deduction in her next paycheck.</p><p begin="00:52:21.77">And Mayor Henderson had some questions about what that meant, which she was too embarrassed to ask, for weeks. The mayor. Not some disempowered nobody-- the mayor. It wasn't until she was giving me a tour of City Hall that she decided to finally stop by the finance office again.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:52:39.82">All right. She's going to interview-- I got to ask you a question. My question is, on the MSD part, is it every pay period, or once a month, that 25% taken out of my pay?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Finance Employee</h4><p begin="00:52:54.00">That is--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:52:56.18">Do you remember? I forgot to ask you. Was it every pay period, or just once?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Finance Employee</h4><p begin="00:53:02.11">Every--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:53:03.83">Every pay period. Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Finance Employee</h4><p begin="00:53:05.68">Every pay period.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Yolanda Henderson</h4><p begin="00:53:07.48">See, if that's the case, that's not right. That's two weeks, every two weeks. That's $300 and some. Mm-hmm.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Finance Employee</h4><p begin="00:53:15.05">It's standard. It's standard. It's a percentage of the income after all deductions. So it is standard.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Chana Joffe-walt</h4><p begin="00:53:26.28">It is standard. Unsurprising. That was actually the most consistent reason people gave for why they don't talk about this. It wasn't that surprising.</p><p begin="00:53:36.57">They did find it surprising when they learned how many of their neighbors had been garnished. But then, just a few minutes later, it stopped feeling surprising. They already knew everyone around them had very little to draw on. It wasn't really a status update. It was just status quo.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:01.27">Chana Joffe-Walt is one of the producers of our program.

    <div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:54:56.10">She was very popular. She was one of, you might say, the queens in high school, right?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:01.43">Do you know where you're going to do this? Do you know where you're going to ask the question?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:55:05.32">Yeah. Yeah, I know where and when.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:07.99">Where is it going to be? What can you say about that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:55:10.09">At her home. Next week.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:14.33">And right before he left to fly and ask her the big question, he changed his plan. He decided that instead of asking her to marry him, he would just tell her his feelings and ask her if she wanted to be in a real committed relationship with him.</p><p begin="00:55:29.10">And he did it. And OK, I'm just going to cut to the chase. She turned him down. Turned him down flat. No interest at all.</p><p begin="00:55:39.51">She'd been married for 50 years. She didn't want it again, with him or anybody. Her life was full of friends. Didn't need it. That's what she said. Though, of course, that's basically the senior citizen way of saying, you know, it's not you, it's me.</p><p begin="00:55:55.18">He says, right at the beginning of his visit, he got a sign of where her feelings were when he made the suggestion for the week together.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:56:02.10">I said, the one thing I would like to do is to shut down the evening, if you didn't mind, by just dancing together, closing the evening down with maybe just 15 minutes or so of dancing. She didn't agree to that. She said, well, I'm not certain about that. That's something I'll have to think about.</p><p begin="00:56:30.57">And of course, she didn't agree to that. And I know why. She didn't want any emotions to be involved, perhaps even her own, you know?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:39.62">He was less sad about it than you might think, because he finally knew the truth, knew it was hopeless with her. He could move on. And he's kind of excited to move on. He says he knows now. If you meet somebody who's truly right for you, it shouldn't take years for both of you to recognize it and feel it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:56:55.87">And if you don't, then it's time to cut it and run.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:59.69">Life's too short.
