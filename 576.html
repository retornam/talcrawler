    <div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:00:17.61">(SINGING) On the 12th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me 12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a leaping, nine ladies dancing, eight maids a milking, seven swans a swimming, six geese a laying, five golden rings, four calling birds, three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:00:49.37">I have always hated that song.</p><p begin="00:00:51.35">[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:00:53.07">I have always hated that song. I feel like that song is symbolic of everything that is bad about Christmas. I should say I have no bad feelings about Christmas. I am a noncombatant when it comes to Christmas.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:01:04.68">I was onstage talking about this song because we had this idea that we thought might make a really fun thing to try for Christmas. And that is we organized a night of improv comedy. And I know maybe you're saying, OK, how does that go together? Why improv comedy and Christmas?</p><p begin="00:01:20.15">OK, well, this is going to take a little explaining. Stay with me. This British writer and performer named Daniel Kitson-- I saw him say this thing about Christmas that seems so true. He says that when you're a kid and you wake up Christmas morning, what makes Christmas feel so magical is this feeling of, like, "Oh, my god. It's going to be amazing. The world is so full of possibility. Anything can happen." The fact that Santa Claus even exists, this literally magical being who came to your home.</p><p begin="00:01:49.93">And Kitson says this thrilled feeling that anything can happen, that is the thing that is so hard to hold onto once we become adults. And in fact, he says that so many adults at Christmas, they try to recreate the same Christmas year after year with the same everything over and over and over. It's like they lock in. Christmas becomes the opposite of "anything can happen." That is why it never feels as magical to adults. But it is possible to get back to that feeling.</p><p begin="00:02:19.67">And, OK, back to the plan for today's show. One place that adults embrace that feeling that anything could happen and it's going to happen and then they make it happen is improv comedy, where, you know, they walk on stage with no idea what anybody is going to say. And then one person tries something. They say something. And then somebody else pitches in with a line of their own, and then somebody else pitches in. And before you know it, they've made like a whole scene, a whole world, really.</p><p begin="00:02:45.42">And so with that in mind, we got these incredible improv comedians, and we got a club to perform in, and we did a show. And we did the show in this particular style of improv, where the people on stage, they tell true stories about their lives. And then those stories, those true stories, become the basis of the improv scenes that they then invent. And those scenes lead them to other true stories that then lead them into other improv scenes and so on and so on and so on.</p><p begin="00:03:11.08">And I was there. I kicked things off with a story about that song, about the song "The 12 Days of Christmas," which is a song that I noticed, even though-- just to say it again-- Christmas is not my day.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:24.68">I am not somebody who celebrates Christmas at all. I'm a Jew. And I'm not that kind of Jew whose parents celebrated Christmas on Hanukkah. We were pure Hanukkah people, and we look down on the Christmas Hanukkah Jews.</p><p begin="00:03:38.59">[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]</p><p begin="00:03:41.35">And in fact, I grew up in a suburb of Baltimore that was so Jewish, I didn't understand that we were in the minority. And so Christmas, I do nothing. It means nothing to me. The day means nothing. And most years, I go to Vegas on Christmas.</p><p begin="00:03:56.54">But I do really love Christmas music. I've always loved Christmas music. And at some point in my 20s, I started to make a collection of Christmas CDs and records. And the worst song of all is the song "The 12 Days of Christmas." And whenever it comes on, I just think, like, why is this still in circulation? First of all, the words refer to a wife and a world that none of us can relate to or care about. "12 lords a leaping," like, what is-- what experience is that even referring to? And then swans are swimming, geese are laying. So are we in a warm climate, a cold climate? It just raises so many questions.</p><p begin="00:04:40.45">But also the form of the song is so intensely boring. And you guys know what I'm talking about, where you do the first one, and then you go back and you do all the ones before it, which you already did. You know I mean? So you do two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree. Then three French hens, two turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree. Then four calling birds, three French hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree. Five golden rings, four calling birds. And so like-- and so you know what's going to happen. It's repetitious in the most boring way, and then it's always sung very slowly, which is annoying.</p><p begin="00:05:10.78">And I don't know why it survived hundred of years to still be around. And my only thought is "five golden rings." "Five golden rings" is the hook of the song. And you've sung the song, right? When you get to five golden rings, everybody breathes a sigh of relief. It's like, (SINGING) five golden rings. And you just feel like, yeah!</p><p begin="00:05:36.79">You know what I mean? It's like the drum solo. That's the hook of the song. And without five golden rings, this song would be nothing.</p></div><div class="host"><p begin="00:05:46.01">Okay, so at this point-- this is me back in the studio talking-- at this point, if I could just describe the stage. Sitting on stools in a row, there are six improv comedians. And we got some of the best people around for this kind of thing. Seriously, we felt so lucky they agreed to be in the show. Aidy Bryant and Sasheer Zamata, they're both on <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night</i> <i>Live</i>. Scott Adsit, he was on <i>30</i> <i>Rock</i>, and before that, he was in Second City. So was Tammy Sagher. Chris Gethard and Mike Birbiglia, they've both been on our radio program before, Mike many, many times. They both have deep improv backgrounds.</p><p begin="00:06:18.13">So six of them are sitting on the stage on these stools. And they listen to that first story that I told to kick things off. And Mike was the first one to stand up and speak.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Birbiglia</h4><p begin="00:06:26.77">Wow. Well, first of all I want to disagree with Ira about that song. I think in some sense, it's sort of the "15 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" of Christmas carols. It's anthemic. It's repetitive. I think where the disconnect happens is that it's just British things.</p><p begin="00:06:48.47">[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:06:54.50">What kind of American things would you put in there? Like a bald eagle? A bald eagle in a-- in a what, oak tree?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Birbiglia</h4><p begin="00:07:01.87">Yeah. Bald eagle in an oak tree. Yeah, we just got to de-British the whole thing. I think that's the problem.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Birbiglia</h4><p begin="00:07:09.19">Lady Haversquire.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Lady Haversquire</h4><p begin="00:07:11.36">Yes?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Mike Birbiglia</h4><p begin="00:07:13.21">We've been courting now for going on 10 months.

But I was in the Chicago Children's Choir. And it was a little kids choir. And the big thing that you do at Christmas is sing Christmas carols. So two things that I remember very well from Christmas choir was one was I got a solo that I got to do. Yeah. And I screwed up, and that was horrifying.</p><p begin="00:11:01.63">The other thing that just occurred to me now is-- so it was on the South Side of Chicago. So it was pretty racially diverse, meaning I usually was the minority, not just as a Jew but as a white person, in choir. And so we also did a lot of gospels, which is where I discovered that I can't clap. And it became something that I would practice at home.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:30.09">Could I just have clarification, just as a fact-checking matter? You would practice clapping.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Woman</h4><p begin="00:11:34.57">Yeah.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:36.02">To what?

I would just turn on the radio, and I'd be like, [CLAPPING] I would just, like, try to clap on the beat. Because if you don't know how to clap and you're in a choir clapping, it's terrifying.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:11:51.97">Bernice, I was watching you sing in the chorus.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Bernice</h4><p begin="00:11:54.64">Oh, wow.

It's just going to sit there, and you're going to look at it and love it. And as soon as I saw it, I was so happy I could not believe my eyes.

And my dad had this tradition. We would have to wait for him to-- we would just shake with anticipation at the top of the stairs, and wait and wait, and bother them, my parents, to get out of bed. And we'd pull them out of bed. And they would take their sweet time putting on their clothes and getting their shaving, just to torture us, because they knew we were at the top of the stairs.</p><p begin="00:23:49.87">And my dad would go downstairs first and say, "Let's see if Santa came." Like, he'd look around the hallway and say, "I don't see any evidence that he's been here." And then he'd walk into the dining room, and he would disappear. And we'd hear him go, "Well, mm, no, nothing in here."</p><p begin="00:24:12.62">And we're up there, going like, "It's the dining room. There's nothing in the dining room!"

And then he'd say-- inevitably, he'd say, "I don't know if he came."</p><p begin="00:24:32.13">The first couple years, we were really nervous that maybe Santa did not come.

Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program, "Say Yes to Christmas," stories where people embrace possibility, try something different, because that is how you get back to the feeling of wonder that children have at Christmas when everything is so new. We have arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, "Oily Potter and the Gobble of Fire."</p><p begin="00:42:51.30">One of our producers, Stephanie Foo, recently discovered a Christmas tradition that's still pretty new in our country that, no kidding, brought her joy, no kidding, made the world seem like a bigger, more wonderful place to her. She has this report.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:43:04.90">I don't remember how I stumbled on my very first turkey explosion video. But I do remember everything else about it. The video is called "Why you should never deep fry a frozen turkey." Two firefighters are standing at the ready in front of a fire truck on a lawn somewhere. In front of them stands a large pot full of hot oil and a propane burner. Another firefighter in full gear comes out with a raw, pink turkey hanging from the end of a long stick.</p><p begin="00:43:31.73">He lowers the turkey into the pot. It's totally submerged in oil. And then the oil bubbles and overflows, spilling everywhere, and a couple of fireballs even burst out of the pot in gusts. And then, just when you think it's over, here comes the best part.</p><p begin="00:43:47.37">[OIL SIZZLING]</p><p begin="00:43:48.84">Suddenly, an enormous, 20-foot column of fire blasts out of the pot, like Sauron himself has been conjured by way of poultry sacrifice.

We stopped counting at 150 videos. They come from Tucson to Pensacola to Danville, California, all made to demonstrate the dangers of deep frying. A lot of the videos were clearly done as segments for local TV stations.</p><p begin="00:44:42.77">But some departments employ different theatrical methods to amp up the drama on the PSAs. Some use slow mo.</p><p begin="00:44:48.65">[OIL SLOWLY SIZZLING]</p><p begin="00:44:51.04">Some play epic music as you watch closeups of the pot of oil.</p><p begin="00:44:54.90">[EPIC MUSIC PLAYING]</p><p begin="00:44:57.19">Some spray water in the pot, obviously something you should never do with a grease fire, as it doubles the size of the flames.

Of course, there's a sub-genre here of people who actually wind up getting their decks on fire and fly into a panic. Just saying-- your average turkey fire incident injures four people-- four-- because it's a spectator sport, which is why fire departments do these videos every year.</p><p begin="00:46:16.94">But after my seventh time watching "Why You Should Never Deep Fry a Turkey," it occurred to me that there's another reason why they do them. I noticed one of the firefighters standing in the back. He was barely suppressing a grin. I zoomed in on him, watched it again-- definitely a grin. So I called him to ask about it. His name is Lieutenant Daniel Akerman of the Escambia County Fire Rescue.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Daniel Akerman</h4><p begin="00:46:40.74">Definitely one of the highlights of being in the office.

Well, we're not following any of the safety recommendations to get it to be that dramatic to show people absolute worst case what can happen.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:47:40.73">Did you guys practice?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:47:42.88">Yeah. We did find out through practice that the more oil we put in the pot, by filling it to the top, made the fireball as big as possible.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:47:54.43">Quick science lesson. These frozen turkeys are filled with ice. Ice, of course, is water. And water does not mix with oil. So when the turkeys hit the oil, that ice turns to water turns to steam, which pushes the oil out of the pot, and when that hits the flame underneath, boom.</p><p begin="00:48:15.79">So your basic turkey frying don'ts are as follows. One, don't put in a frozen turkey. You should thaw your turkey 24 hours for every five pounds. That's three whole days for a 15-pounder. Two, don't put in a wet turkey or a too-big turkey. Three, don't overfill the pot with oil or overheat the oil. Four, do not do this inside. And lastly, most fire departments would tell you the most important don't is just please, don't deep fry a turkey at all.</p><p begin="00:48:48.53">Fargo double did all the don'ts. Like, while some firefighters heat their demonstration pots to 350, Fargo took theirs to 700. The pot of oil is obviously already in flames and overflowing before the turkey gets anywhere near it, like an active volcano.</p><p begin="00:49:11.87">I managed to find the first turkey fire video from 2002. It's called "Turkey Fryer-- Your Dinner for Your Life?" It's hosted by this earnest guy in a hardhat named John Drengenberg, who was not in it for the fun, the fame, or the fireballs. I asked him, is he proud of being the originator of this new holiday tradition, the turkey explosion video?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Drengenberg</h4><p begin="00:49:32.88">OK, first of all, I'm an engineer.

It's in keeping with our mission of alerting people to safety issues.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:49:59.64">Sure. But you know, outside of the mission, what does it make you feel?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Drengenberg</h4><p begin="00:50:04.87">Like we've accomplished a goal of alerting people to the dangers.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:50:12.37">John works for Underwriters Laboratories. They test products to make sure they're safe. I just walked over to the part of our office that has a toaster and a coffee grinder, and I found UL logos on everything, even the light bulbs. And so when John started testing turkey deep fryers at UL in 2002, he found them so egregiously dangerous and prone to failure that they put out a press release calling for stronger turkey fryer guidelines. And because most people don't read press releases, he figured they had to make a PSA informing people about those dangers, too, because John sees danger around us all the time. And he does not think the turkey videos are sensationalistic in the slightest.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Drengenberg</h4><p begin="00:50:52.30">I think we tried to show the reality. Even if you're using it correctly, and a dog runs by it or it could bump into the stand and knock the turkey fryer down, which would cause some very serious burns on a pet, as well as a child.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:51:09.48">Do your friends and family ever-- are you, like, calling them out and being like, please don't do that.

Make sure you water your tree. You have to run your hand along on  the branches in the tree lot to make sure you don't end up with a handful of needles. If you do, the tree is too dry. You should never bring it home. There are statistics you can get, by the way, Stephanie, from places like the Consumer Product Safety Commission on just how many people are injured each year while decorating. I mean, it's like 18,000 people hurt themselves decorating.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:52:32.22">Oh, my god.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Drengenberg</h4><p begin="00:52:33.67">Yeah, we could talk for two hours, if you'd like, about cautionary tips.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:52:37.96">Jeez, well, why even celebrate at all?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Drengenberg</h4><p begin="00:52:41.05">Oh, that's-- we're not grinches here. We just want to keep people safe. That's our mission, whatever your holiday. And it's not just Christmas. It's Hanukkah. It's Kwanzaa, all of that. And all of those holidays, by the way, use candles.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:52:55.92">[LAUGHS]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>John Drengenberg</h4><p begin="00:52:57.32">You want go into candles? You ready for candles? Can you handle it?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Stephanie Foo</h4><p begin="00:53:03.60">John suggests that in lieu of candles this year, try using LED tealights instead. And if you think that's too drastic, please go to YouTube right now and type in the words "Christmas tree fires." And then help John have a Merry Christmas. Go water your tree.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:24.63">Stephanie Foo is one of the producers of our program. We checked, by the way, with the Consumer Product Safety Commission and learned that on average, there were only about 13-- 13-- turkey fryer-related incidents a year, which means one of two things, OK? Either number one, the hundreds of turkey fryer fire videos online are unnecessary. Or, number two, the hundreds of turkey fryer fire videos online are working.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Three. The First Noel.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:53:51.86">Act Three, "The First Noelle." Andre is six years old. And this is his first Christmas with, you know, Santa and presents and the whole deal. And already, it's been like one incredible thing after another. Till recently, he and his little brother, Luke, who's four, had been in an orphanage in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And in the orphanage, Christmas was not much of a thing.</p><p begin="00:54:12.94">But now they're living outside Seattle, where it definitely is a thing. Weeks ago, Christmas lights started popping up.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:54:19.02">And they would point to that and say, Mom, Mom, look at that. And so we started to explain, yeah, that's for Christmas. It's to celebrate Christmas.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:27.26">This is Jennefer. She and her husband adopted Andre and Luke.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:54:30.51">And then we drove through the neighborhood, just with the purpose of looking for lights, they were just non-stop. It didn't matter how big the light display was. They were amazed.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:54:43.51">Wow! Wow!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:54:45.43">But look at Snoopy!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:54:47.82">Bye!</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:54:48.78">Snoopy!</p><p begin="00:54:49.26">[LAUGHTER]</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:54:49.74">This is obviously from a recording they made on that drive. Jennefer and her husband also have two little girls, seven and five, who you can hear on the recording.</p><p begin="00:54:56.82">[KIDS OOHING AND AHHING]</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Man</h4><p begin="00:54:57.77">Do you see two of them in the [INAUDIBLE]?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:55:01.10">Whoa.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:55:02.54">And no one wanted to go home. They just couldn't get enough of it.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Child</h4><p begin="00:55:08.61">Whoa.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:09.46">It's been kind of a crash course since the boys arrived in the States. They just got here this November. They'd heard some Christmas basics before. This adoption process has taken three years. And Jennefer lived with the boys in Kinshasa for most of this year, and she talked about Christmas a little bit with the boys. But you know, if you think about it, it is a lot to cover. With her girls, you know, from the time that they could speak, they were basically living in a world with Christmas and Santa and all that, but with the boys--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:34.89">It must have been strange for you. You really have to start at the beginning and walk through a whole lot of stuff. And it's like, there's reindeer, and there's like this whole-- it's really like kind of a lot to explain, right?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:55:46.64">Right, yeah. We had to hit a lot of basics. Who is Rudolph? Who is even Santa? I mean, the fact that we had a Christmas tree in our house, oh. And even that we went to pick out a Christmas tree and then tied this tree onto our car-- you know, the little things that we just do every year so we don't really think about it as strange. But when you were a kid and you see a tree tied to a car, or you're tying it to your own car, he'd be like, "Why? What are they doing to the tree? Why are they putting it on the roof?" And we opened up the sunroof while he was in there, just the window part so he could see it. And he just stared at it in awe.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:28.33">One of the recordings you made is of, I guess, Andre saying over and over, "Are you kidding me, guys? Are you kidding me, guys? Are you kidding me, guys?" What's that about?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:56:37.49">Yeah, he kept opening new ornaments and seeing a new ornament. We have a tradition in our family that we hang up an ornament with a picture of each child each year. So they were both really excited to see their own faces on ornaments as they hung them up. So--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Andre</h4><p begin="00:56:54.84">Are you kidding me, guys? Are you kidding me, guys? Are you kidding me, guys?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:57:02.34">His English is so new, so he usually uses that when he sees something that he really likes.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:10.48">Growing up in the orphanage, not only did they not have ornaments and trees and Santa, they didn't get presents-- not for Christmas, not for birthdays.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:57:18.43">Yeah, you know, they didn't really have belongings before. Everything was shared at the orphanage.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:25.12">Neither of them ever asked anybody for a gift or picked out a present to give to somebody. That's all new.</p><p begin="00:57:31.61">Of course, Christmas is just one of the new things that they're experiencing in their new lives in this country. The orphanage that they lived in was on the outskirts of Kinshasa and didn't have electricity or running water. Even going to a store was a new experience for the boys when they joined Jennefer's family.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Jennefer</h4><p begin="00:57:46.15">Everything's amazing right now, so it's not hard to believe that Santa comes and brings you gifts. That's just one of the many things.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:57:55.64">Compared with the incredibleness of, you know, living in a house with water that comes out of faucets, and a play room, and a family, Santa Claus, the idea of Santa Claus, that's just really just like one more thing on the list, right? A guy flies in with a sleigh in the middle of the night with a bag of presents? Why not? It's all kind of amazing if we just let ourselves see it that way.</p></div>  </div>
