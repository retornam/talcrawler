"First think," it says, "why would the Wolfman come to your house out of all the houses in Brooklyn?" But if you're afraid, here's what you do. Number one, sleep with a glass with water in it. Number two, Peter tells you to close the blinds, get under the covers, put a fan on.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Cantor</h4><p begin="00:01:18.36">Number three, "if he comes in, put covers over your whole body. Don't move."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:24.75">Like he'll never suspect you're there.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Cantor</h4><p begin="00:01:26.78">Exactly. This is what to do if a Wolfman with a low IQ comes to your house. "Four, if you want the satisfaction of killing him, take the glass and splash the water in his face." Then it switches. It says, B.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:44.20">Wait, we've gone from one, two, three, four, and now we're going B, C, D?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Cantor</h4><p begin="00:01:48.20">Right.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:01:49.17">What's interesting is that one instinctively knows, even in the sixth grade, that if there's going to be a how-to, there are going to have to be steps and substeps.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Cantor</h4><p begin="00:01:56.71">Yes. I think in sixth grade-- I don't know if this is a digression or not. It is a digression. Can I digress, or should I stick to the text?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:02:03.36">No, no, no. Digress away.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Cantor</h4><p begin="00:02:07.03">In sixth grade, I think there's a general sense of kind of that the universe has an order, and they know a few key terms that guide that order. But some of the specifics sort of escape them. So for example, I had a sixth grader who wrote a story, and I knew it was a very, very steamy story, because when he went to give it to me, he was surrounded by all of his friends who were kind of giggling madly and sort of quite shocked that he gave it to me and then raced out of the room.</p><p begin="00:02:36.62">And the story involved a man and a woman who were having a romantic evening in front of the fire. And there was soft music playing. And finally, to show that this was truly a romantic evening, the man takes a bottle of white wine-- it was very clear, white wine that they had been drinking-- and pours it all over the woman, which is I guess a sign that this is amorous.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:06.30">The kid had the props right-- the fire, the soft music, the wine. He just wasn't clear on how everything fit together, which, in a way, happens all through this how-to. It's a hodgepodge. The dinosaur advice has images lifted straight from <i>Jurassic</i> <i>Park</i>. The Wolfman section has one practical piece of advice taken, really, from any middle-class dinner table in Brooklyn. "After you kill the Wolfman," it says, "if you think your mom will get mad from all the blood, take seltzer and paper towels and pat it. Then scrub."</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:03:42.10">Why do you think he did this as a how-to? What is it about the how-to form that would be so attractive?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Melissa Cantor</h4><p begin="00:03:49.29">I think that the how-to form makes it seem like the world will follow certain rules. And if you follow certain rules, you'll be safe. And it puts it, I think, in your control. Because obviously, you have no control over whether or not the Wolfman or aliens come to your house.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:04:14.93">The how-to form. It's ingrained in us. It's part of what we are, how we make sense of the universe. Consider this story. In 1696, in England, the law changed, and suddenly people in England could publish whatever they wanted without getting it approved first by the king and his censor. And so there was this explosion of publishing. And within just a few decades, the single most popular kind of book, as soon as people could sell and buy any kind of books they chose, these were how-to books. In particular, how-to books written to teach people, mostly women, how, through education, self-control, and hard work, any family could better itself, could enter what we come to think of now as the middle class.</p><p begin="00:04:58.96">And here's where it gets interesting. The advice books on how to become middle class came before the existence of an actual middle class. People followed the how-to instructions, bettered themselves, and the middle class emerged. We would not be who we are today without how-to. There's a straight line from those 18th century books of personal betterment to every Tony Robbins infomercial, every Jane Fonda workout video, every Martha Stewart magazine article-- stuff that gives you both step-by-step instructions and a motivational dream, a dream that you can transform yourself into a different person.</p><p begin="00:05:41.66">Which brings us to today's show. Each week on our program, of course we choose theme and bring you a variety of different stories on that theme. Today's show, how-to's, and what happens during a how-to, and what our how-to's say about us.</p><p begin="00:05:56.28">Act One of today's show, Roadrunner, in which I teach one of our regular contributors, Sarah Vowell, how to drive, and I find out that a simple how-to is never as simple as you think.</p><p begin="00:06:07.48">Act Two, How to Date a Blackgirl, Browngirl, Whitegirl, or Halfie. Junot Diaz explains what to do with the government-issued cheese in the refrigerator when you bring a date over to the house.</p><p begin="00:06:18.18">Act Three, How to Increase Your Value as a Person, an act in which we try to tackle the biggest possible how-to we could think of, how to make your life worth more.

    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:06:38.49">Act One, Roadrunner. We don't even agree on where this story begins. As far as I was concerned, it was just another how-to story. Our contributing editor Sarah Vowell wanted to learn how to drive, and I would teach her in two quick lessons.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:06:52.79">For me, it wasn't even about driving. It was about fear. Nothing scares me more than driving. Nothing. I can't even ride a bike without mangling my digits and hitting parked cars. I've always been terrified that I'd get behind the wheel and it would be a big Shangri-La song with people screaming, "Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out!" Somehow I didn't mention this to Ira before we began.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:17.80">And this, I think, is how it usually goes with any how-to. A how-to seems like the most rational, orderly thing in the world. You know you do step one. You do step two, step three. Follow the diagram and instructions. Before you know it, creme brulee or the toy train set is assembled, or you're a more effective, convincing public speaker, whatever. But in fact, the logical step-by-step process is just a veneer of civilization cutting the vast paranoia that is not knowing, and the process of learning itself, which is inherently irrational, which brings us to the car guys.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Magliozzi</h4><p begin="00:07:51.92">Hey.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Magliozzi</h4><p begin="00:07:52.83">Hello?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:07:53.76">Tom and Ray?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Magliozzi</h4><p begin="00:07:54.53">Yeah, who's this?

Now what happens when a car is coming in the other direction which also wants to take a left turn? Got it?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Tom Magliozzi</h4><p begin="00:08:33.00">Yeah, got it.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:34.17">What was I thinking? Tom and Ray articulated rules of the road so obscure that no one actually follows them.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ray Magliozzi</h4><p begin="00:08:40.96">And there's not one driver in 50,000 who conforms to that rule.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:08:44.92">Wait a second.

And to most people, that sounds like such a loony idea. But my sister and I are twins, and when you're a twin, there can be a very clear division of labor. I did the mental things. She did the physical ones. I learned to read before she did. She learned to ride a bike years before I did. Driving was her jurisdiction. Criticizing her driving was mine.</p><p begin="00:10:19.15">After one humiliating attempt to learn when I was 16, I simply blocked the possibility out of my mind. I'm never going to drive, like I'm never going to murder anyone, like I'm never going to like Celine Dion. It was that huge.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:10:33.31">So it comes the day when Sarah's supposed to go down to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get her learner's permit. And she stops by, and I'm still thinking that we're just doing this little radio story, not realizing that, in fact, this is her greatest phobia. And I notice that she has this look on her face that I can only describe as pre-throw up, as she nervously flips through a copy of the Illinois state driving rules.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:10:59.47">So the second I opened it-- and this has been going on for days, you know. The second I opened it, I have been extremely anxious. It was like opening it up, boom. I was another person. I had just been tapping my fingers and nervous.

Yeah.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:11:28.39">Yes.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarah Vowell</h4><p begin="00:11:29.57">Good.

The car class in the elite. The car class is the upper class. The car class has all the power, makes all the rules.

  <h3>Act Two. How To Date A Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl, Or Halfie.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:33:45.39">It's <i>This</i> <i>American</i> <i>Life</i>. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, invite a variety of writers and reporters and performers to tackle that theme. Today's program, How-to. What happens during a how-to, what our how-to's say about us. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, How to Date a Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl, or Halfie.</p><p begin="00:34:04.08">You know, one of the most common kinds of how-to's, going back to when they begin has always involved how to act to seem attractive to someone else. In that genre, we offer this story from Junot Diaz. A warning that some of this might not be suitable for younger listeners.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Junot Diaz</h4><p begin="00:34:21.40">Wait for your brother and your mother to leave the apartment. You've already told them that you're feeling too sick to go to Union City to visit that tia who likes to squeeze your nuts. "He's gotten big," she'll say. And even though your moms knows you ain't sick, you stuck to your story until finally she said, "Go ahead and stay, malcriado."</p><p begin="00:34:41.36">Clear the government cheese from the refrigerator. If the girl's from the Terrace, stack the boxes behind the milk. If she's from the Park or Society Hill, hide the cheese in the cabinet above the oven, way up where she'll never see. Leave yourself a reminder to get it out before morning or your moms will kick your ass.</p><p begin="00:35:03.19">Take down any embarrassing photos of your family in the campo, especially the one with the half naked kids dragging a goat on a rope leash. The kids are your cousins, and by now they're old enough to understand why you're doing what you're doing. Hide the pictures of yourself with an Afro. Make sure the bathroom is presentable. Put the basket with all the crapped-on toilet paper under the sink. Spray the bucket with the Lysol, then close the cabinet. Shower, comb, dress. Sit on the couch and watch TV.</p><p begin="00:35:34.42">If she's an outsider, her father will be bringing her, maybe her mother. Neither of them want her seeing any boys from the Terrace. People get stabbed in the Terrace. But she's strongheaded, and this time will get her way. If she's a white girl, you know you'll at least get a hand job.</p><p begin="00:35:53.31">The directions were in your best handwriting, so her parents won't think you're an idiot. Get up from the couch and check the parking lot. Nothing. If the girl's local, don't sweat it. She'll flow over when she's good and ready. Sometimes she'll run into her other friends, and a whole crowd will show up at your apartment. And even though that means you ain't getting [BLEEP], it will be fun anyway and you'll wish these people would come over more often.</p><p begin="00:36:17.65">Sometimes the girl won't flow over at all, and the next day in school, she'll say, sorry, and smile. And you'll be stupid enough to believe her and ask her out again.</p><p begin="00:36:31.14">Wait, and after an hour, go out to your corner. The neighborhood is full of traffic. Give one of your boys a shout, and when he says, "Are you still waiting on that bitch?" say, "Hell yeah." Get back inside. Call her house. And when her father picks up, ask if she's there. He'll ask, "Who is this?" Hang up. He sounds like a principal or a police chief, the sort of dude with a big neck who never has to watch his back.</p><p begin="00:37:01.71">Sit and wait. By the time your stomach's ready to give out on you, a Honda or maybe a Jeep pulls in, and out she comes. "Hey," you'll say. "Look," she'll say, "my mom wants to meet you. She's got herself all worried about nothing." Don't panic. Say, "Hey, no problem." Run a hand through your hair like the white boys do, even though the only thing that runs easily through your hair is Africa.</p><p begin="00:37:34.42">She will look good. The white ones are the ones you want the most, but usually the out-of-towners are black-- black girls who grew up with ballet and Girl Scouts, who have three cars in their driveways. If she's a halfie, don't be surprised that her mother is white. Say hi. Her moms will say hi, and you will see that you don't scare her, not really.</p><p begin="00:37:55.32">She will say that she needs easier directions to get out. And even though she has the best directions in her lap, give her new ones. Make her happy.</p><p begin="00:38:07.76">You have choices. If the girl is from around the way, take her to El Cibao for dinner. Order everything in your busted up Spanish. Let her correct you if she's Latina, and amaze her if she's black. If she's not from around the way, Wendy's will do.</p><p begin="00:38:23.51">As you walk to the restaurant, talk about school. A local girl won't need the stories about the neighborhood, but the other ones might. Supply the story about the loco who had been storing canisters of tear gas in his basement for years, how one day the canisters cracked and the whole neighborhood got a dose of the military strength stuff. Don't tell her that your moms knew right away what it was, that she recognized its smell from the year the United States invaded your island.</p><p begin="00:38:50.03">Hope that you don't run into your nemesis, Howie, the Puerto Rican kid with the two killer mutts. He walks them all over the neighborhood, and every now and then, the mutts corner themselves a cat and tear it to shreds. Howie laughing as the cat flips up in the air, its neck twisted around like an owl, red meat showing through the soft fur. If his dogs haven't cornered a cat, he will walk behind you and ask, "Hey, Junior, is that your new [BLEEP]?" Let him talk.</p><p begin="00:39:18.06">Howie weighs about 200 pounds and could eat you if he wanted. At the field, he will turn away. He has new sneakers and doesn't want them muddy. If the girl's an outsider, she will hiss now and say, "What a [BLEEP] asshole." A homegirl would have been yelling back at him the whole time unless she was shy. Either way, don't feel bad that you didn't do anything. Never lose a fight on your first date or that will be the end of it.</p><p begin="00:39:48.54">Dinner will be tense. You are not good at talking to people you don't know. A halfie will tell you that her parents met in the movement, will say, "Back then, people thought it a radical thing to do." It will sound like something her parents made her memorize. Your brother once heard that one and said, "Man, that sounds like a whole lot of Uncle Tomming to me." Don't repeat this. Put down your hamburger and say, "It must have been hard." She will appreciate your interest. She will tell you more. "Black people," she will say, "treat me real bad. That's why I don't like them."</p><p begin="00:40:25.42">You'll wonder how she feels about Dominicans. Don't ask. Let her speak on it, and when you're both finished eating, walk back into the neighborhood. The skies will be magnificent. Pollutants have made Jersey sunsets one of the wonders of the world. Point it out. Touch her shoulder and say, "That's nice, right?"</p><p begin="00:40:49.64">Get serious. Watch TV, but stay alert. Sip some of the rum your father left in the cabinet, which nobody touches. A local girl may have hips and a thick ass, but she won't be quick about letting you touch. She has to live in the same neighborhood as you, has to deal with you being in her business. She might just chill with you and then go home. She might kiss you and then go. Or she might, if she's reckless, give it up, but that's rare. Kissing will suffice.</p><p begin="00:41:19.20">A white girl might just give it up right then. Don't stop her. She'll take her gum out of her mouth, stick it to the plastic sofa covers, and then will move close to you. "You have nice eyes," she might say. Tell her that you love her hair, that you love her skin, her lips, because in truth, you love them more than you love your own. She will say, "I like Spanish guys." And even though you've never been to Spain, say, "I like you." You'll sound smooth.</p><p begin="00:41:48.04">You'll be with her until about 8:30, and then she'll want to wash up. In the bathroom, she will hum a song from the radio and her waist will keep the beat against the lip of the sink. Imagine her old lady coming to get her, what she would say if she knew her daughter had just laid under you and blown your name, pronounced with her eighth grade Spanish, into your ear. While she's in the bathroom, call one of your boys and say, Lo hice, loco. Or just sit back on the couch and smile.</p><p begin="00:42:23.49">But usually-- usually it won't work this way. Be prepared. She will not want to kiss you. "Just cool it," she'll say. The halfie might lean back, breaking away from you. She will cross her arms, say, "I hate my tits." Stroke her hair, but she will pull away. "I don't like anyone touching my hair," she will say. She will act like somebody you don't know. In school, she is known for her attention-grabbing laugh, as high and far ranging as a gull. But here she will worry you. You will not know what to say. "You're the only kind of guy who asks me out," she will say. "You and the black boys."</p><p begin="00:43:08.59">Say nothing. Let her button her shirt. Let her comb her hair, the sound of it stretching like a sheet of fire between you. When her father pulls in and beeps, let her go without too much of a goodbye. She won't want it. During the next hour, the phone will ring. You will be tempted to pick it up. Don't. Watch the shows you want to watch without a family around to debate you. Don't go downstairs. Don't fall asleep. It won't help. Put the government cheese back in its place before your mother kills you.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:43:56.06">Junot Diaz's story is in his book <i>Drown.</i></p><p begin="00:43:57.49">[MUSIC - "FINE BROWN FRAME" BY NELLIE LUTCHER]</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Act Three. How To Increase Your Value As A Person.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:44:17.84">Act Three, How to Increase Your Value as a Person. Most how-to's make a promise. You're not just going to learn skills. You will be transformed. So, putting together today's program, we thought, what would be the ultimate transformation? What how-to could actually increase the value of human life? And it turns out that we as a society have people whose job it is to think about this very question. And they turned out to be insurance adjusters. Insurance adjusters.</p><p begin="00:44:43.69">When somebody dies, insurance adjusters review the facts of the case, consider how much juries usually pay for various kinds of lifes and deaths when somebody dies and somebody else is to blame. And then the adjusters recommend how much the insurance company should settle for, what the life was worth. Adam Davidson put together this how-to on how to increase the value of your life.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:45:02.95">When I was seven, my mom told me about a guy who died because his car blew up. It was the manufacturer's fault, and the man's relatives sued and got about $300,000. I remember wondering about that number. I remember thinking if you were going to assign a number to a human life, it would have to be huge, at least a million. To my seven-year-old mind, a million seemed like the start of the really big numbers.</p><p begin="00:45:27.03">The other day, I wanted to find out how much my life was worth, so I went to talk to this guy George Karas, an adjuster in Merrillville, Indiana. He looked me over, asked me my stats-- age, job, marital status.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:45:40.10"> Right now, today, I'm willing to pay you $35,000.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:45:47.36">For my death?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:45:48.49">For your death. Total.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:45:51.22">That's crazy.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:45:52.70">What do you think it's worth?</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:46:02.36">My life, worth less than half a second of one commercial on <i>Seinfeld</i>. George explains it this way-- I'm single, got no dependents. And as far as he's concerned, no one would be all that affected by my death. I argued with him, pointed out my parents need me. I make them laugh. I tease them in a way that nobody else can.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:46:21.46">How often do they see you?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:46:24.35">My mom sees me once a month, my dad every three months.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:46:26.87">Once a month and every three months. How close are you to them? Do you take them out for dinner? Do you always meet them on family holidays? Do you sit around the fireplace with them at night and roast marshmallows?</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:46:41.66">Those things are worth money?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:46:43.15">Absolutely. Loss of love and affection. In your case, there doesn't appear to be that strong emotional relationship.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:46:52.35"> Why, no, I'm very close to my parents.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:46:54.87">You see your dad once every three months. Does he send you a picture in between so you remember what he looks like?</p><p begin="00:47:08.08">Girlfriends don't count.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:47:09.89">They don't count?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:47:10.85">Absolutely not.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:47:12.01">I see my girlfriend every day, and we're madly in love.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>George Karas</h4><p begin="00:47:14.43">If you love her that much, marry her. Show her the respect to quit shacking up and marry her. And then she'll count.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:47:28.23">There's no government chart or general agreement on how much people are worth. If you die and it's someone else's fault, you could be worth as little as a few hundred bucks or as much as a quarter of a billion dollars to your survivors. To come up with a dollar amount for a person's life, insurance adjusters add fixed costs-- medical bills, funeral expenses-- to the more intangible costs, things like loss of comfort, love, affection, guidance.</p><p begin="00:47:53.85">Obviously figuring out the intangible values is more difficult, but there are basic principles that adjusters and the courts go by. The more people you have dependent on you and the more people you affect positively, the more you're worth. So if you want to increase your value, here's how. Join community groups, tutor some poor kids. Marrying your girlfriend or boyfriend adds a couple million dollars to your value. And while you're at it, have sex with them a lot. Losing the pleasure of sex with you can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Remember, girlfriends don't count. Have a child. That will add another two million. A second or third or fourth child doesn't add anything.</p><p begin="00:48:32.60">A college degree usually increases your value by millions, same for a high paying professional job. But if you really want to go for the hard cash, the thing to do is suffer. Nothing gets a jury going like misery. Another adjuster, Sarelle Povitsky, explained that to really increase your value after a tragic accident, don't die. Live, but be severely injured.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:48:55.24">Yeah, right. Brain dead or paraplegic quads, those really demand a lot of money because there's so much future care involved in that. Yeah, the quad is worse because you are really struggling each and every single day.</p><p begin="00:49:22.17">To increase your value, I would probably say burn. That's the worst injury are burns.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:49:28.68">Why is that?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:49:29.71">Because there's no relief from that pain. I mean, they put cream on them, but there's really no relief. There's nothing they can do for you. So I would say burns over most of your body would be--</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:49:40.11">The best way to increase your value.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:49:41.28">--the best way to increase your value. There's so much pain and suffering with that. And then the next thing would be to be brain dead.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:49:56.58">An insurance adjuster told me about a young guy driving a truck full of tires. He crashed. The car caught fire, and the tires pinned him inside. He slowly burned to death, begging for his life. He was a menial worker, single, no kids. Normally, the adjuster told me, he wouldn't be worth 30 grand. But his parents got a tremendous settlement because of his suffering. And it struck me, as I heard this, that in financial terms, the last 10 minutes of this man's life were worth more than the whole 25 years that came before.</p><p begin="00:50:38.00">Anyone who looks at this stuff realizes pretty quickly that there's something irrational in all these schemes. For example, the single most important factor in determining your worth is not who you are, what you've done, who you love. It's the state or county where you die. In general, if you die in a big city, you'll be worth a lot more than if you die in a rural farming community. Juries in big cities are just more generous.</p><p begin="00:51:03.07">Adjusters say if you're going to die, die in Chicago or New York, preferably the Bronx, LA, Detroit. Florida is pretty good. Avoid New England, especially Maine. Stay away from the Rockies states. Don't die in Utah. You definitely don't want to die anywhere you can see the stars at night.</p><p begin="00:51:21.59">George Karas, the adjuster in rural Indiana, told me I would be lucky to get 50 grand for my life, but Sarelle, who works in Chicago's Cook County, knew her juries would be more sympathetic.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:51:32.51">You have this future potential. God only knows where you could have gone with your degree and being a freelance person in communications. The whole world is open to you, and all of that is closed because you've died. So I would say that for sympathy factor, it's possible in Cook County to get a million dollar or better verdict.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:51:59.79">A million dollars, the price I dreamed of when I was seven. I asked Sarelle what I could do to increase my value even above that. And what she said kind of shocked and disappointed me. Essentially she told me I would have to reinvent myself. In particular, I would have to spend more time outside. It's a peculiar quirk of our legal system that people who enjoy outdoor activities are worth more than people who just stay inside and watch TV.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:52:26.09">OK, here's what you should do to add value to your life, if you can. If you enjoy swimming or sunsets or gardening, or any of those things that create beauty in the world, try to do that, because that gives you added value.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:52:41.65">Here's one thing I was thinking of. I like to read sort of obscure plays. I like to read sort of historical plays, which I'd imagine most people really could care less about. What about people who have-- let's say there's a guy, you could say he watches TV all the time, but what he's doing is he's watching videotapes of incredible foreign films. Is that going to--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:53:07.32">Impact the verdict? No, I don't think so. See, the reason being-- so everybody watches TV and everybody reads. I don't know if it's necessarily the content that's important. The person that we're talking about who's involved in the community, who is very active in sports and loves sunsets, and all that kind of stuff, he gives more to the world than the person who maybe watches historical plays. You know what I mean? It's not content. It's the whole value of the person's life, what they've done with it, how involved they are. That gives you the greater value.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:53:45.19">Right. Because the things that I feel add value to my life as I experience it, for me-- because I'm not much of an outdoors person-- what I feel adds the richness to my life personally really is reading. It's reading literature, reading nonfiction, and seeing wonderful films. I mean, that's something I really get a lot of deep pleasure.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:54:09.45">But I don't know that that adds value to your life, because we all do it. I love reading. I love going to movies. That's something you do personally. No one's dependent on you to do that. It's just something you yourself are being enriched from. And I don't know that that would have a great deal of value.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:54:35.91">So the jocks who I hated in high school and felt were worth less than I was, it turns out they're worth--</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Sarelle Povitsky</h4><p begin="00:54:44.24">More. Yeah.</p></div><div class="host"><h4>Adam Davidson</h4><p begin="00:54:53.23">We look to systems of rules, to how-to schemes, to create order out of situations that inherently defy rationality. And it always amazes me to think that when this particular system does its job, a check is cut, it has a dollar amount on it, and that's supposed to be the value of somebody's life.</p><p begin="00:55:13.58">I talked to one adjuster who said that when someone loses a loved one, they don't want money. They want to get rid of their pain. They want that person back. They're angry, and they want whoever caused the death to suffer. But the only thing we can give them is money. That's all we have. That's all we can do.</p></div>  </div>

  <h3>Credits.</h3>
  <div class="act-inner">
    <div class="host"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:55:46.76">Well this, of course, is the point in our program when we do the credits. And we thought, as part of that, we would have one last how-to. And to help with that how-to, I'd like to welcome to the program my dad, Barry Glass, now a certified public accountant in Baltimore, but in his younger days was a disc jockey in college radio and commercial radio.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:06.88">And, Dad?</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:07.39">Yes.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:08.46">Now, when you and I talked about the show, you've had a particular criticism of the way I do the show.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:14.13">Well, it was a constructive criticism. Let me put it that way. Let me start by being defensive.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:18.84">[LAUGHS] Well, it was a constructive criticism, which is why I invited you here today.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Barry Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:24.98">And knowing from past experience, when I used to have to do things like closing credits, they get to be very mundane and things you do all the time. And sometimes you just roll right through them without a lot of emotion or maybe without sounding like a lot of caring. And that was my criticism to you.</p></div><div class="interviewer"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:46.99">Just so people at home can hear, let's just play some credits from a recent show so they can hear what you're talking about.</p></div><div class="subject"><h4>Ira Glass</h4><p begin="00:56:52.39">Our program produced today by Julie Snyder and myself with Alix Spiegel and Nancy Updike.
